            (A) The temporal dissection of mutation signatures 1 and M1 associated with aging-related processes
            revealed a bias towards early occurrence.
            (B) By contrast, signature 5, which has previously also been associated with aging, was late-occurring
            in cancers with signature 5 elevation.
            (C) Aging-related signatures were ubiquitous across cancer types but particularly elevated in colorectal
            and esophageal cancers.
            (D) Signature 5 was particularly elevated in head & neck, esophageal, and ovarian cancers.
