abstract = {Ionizing radiation is a potent carcinogen, inducing cancer through DNA damage. The signatures of mutations arising in human tissues following in vivo exposure to ionizing radiation have not been documented. Here, we searched for signatures of ionizing radiation in 12 radiation-associated second malignancies of different tumour types. Two signatures of somatic mutation characterize ionizing radiation exposure irrespective of tumour type. Compared with 319 radiation-naive tumours, radiation-associated tumours carry a median extra 201 deletions genome-wide, sized 1-100 base pairs often with microhomology at the junction. Unlike deletions of radiation-naive tumours, these show no variation in density across the genome or correlation with sequence context, replication timing or chromatin structure. Furthermore, we observe a significant increase in balanced inversions in radiation-associated tumours. Both small deletions and inversions generate driver mutations. Thus, ionizing radiation generates distinctive mutational signatures that explain its carcinogenic potential.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The diversity of clinical tumor profiling approaches (small panels to whole exomes with matched or unmatched germline analysis) may engender uncertainty about their benefits and liabilities, particularly in light of reported germline false positives in tumor-only profiling and use of global mutational and/or neoantigen data. The goal of this study was to determine the impact of genomic analysis strategies on error rates and data interpretation across contexts and ancestries.
METHODS: We modeled common tumor profiling modalities-large (n = 300 genes), medium (n = 48 genes), and small (n = 15 genes) panels-using clinical whole exomes (WES) from 157 patients with lung or colon adenocarcinoma. We created a tumor-only analysis algorithm to assess germline false positive rates, the impact of patient ancestry on tumor-only results, and neoantigen detection.
RESULTS: After optimizing a germline filtering strategy, the germline false positive rate with tumor-only large panel sequencing was 14 {\%} (144/1012 variants). For patients whose tumor-only results underwent molecular pathologist review (n = 91), 50/54 (93 {\%}) false positives were correctly interpreted as uncertain variants. Increased germline false positives were observed in tumor-only sequencing of non-European compared with European ancestry patients (p {\textless} 0.001; Fisher's exact) when basic germline filtering approaches were used; however, the ExAC database (60,706 germline exomes) mitigated this disparity (p = 0.53). Matched and unmatched large panel mutational load correlated with WES mutational load (r(2) = 0.99 and 0.93, respectively; p {\textless} 0.001). Neoantigen load also correlated (r(2) = 0.80; p {\textless} 0.001), though WES identified a broader spectrum of neoantigens. Small panels did not predict mutational or neoantigen load.
CONCLUSIONS: Large tumor-only targeted panels are sufficient for most somatic variant identification and mutational load prediction if paired with expanded germline analysis strategies and molecular pathologist review. Paired germline sequencing reduced overall false positive mutation calls and WES provided the most neoantigens. Without patient-matched germline data, large germline databases are needed to minimize false positive mutation calling and mitigate ethnic disparities.

abstract = {Elucidation of mutagenic processes shaping cancer genomes is a fundamental problem whose solution promises insights into new treatment, diagnostic and prevention strategies. Single-strand DNA-specific APOBEC cytidine deaminase(s) are major source(s) of mutation in several cancer types. Previous indirect evidence implicated APOBEC3B as the more likely major mutator deaminase, whereas the role of APOBEC3A is not established. Using yeast models enabling the controlled generation of long single-strand genomic DNA substrates, we show that the mutation signatures of APOBEC3A and APOBEC3B are statistically distinguishable. We then apply three complementary approaches to identify cancer samples with mutation signatures resembling either APOBEC. Strikingly, APOBEC3A-like samples have over tenfold more APOBEC-signature mutations than APOBEC3B-like samples. We propose that APOBEC3A-mediated mutagenesis is much more frequent because APOBEC3A itself is highly proficient at generating DNA breaks, whose repair can trigger the formation of single-strand hypermutation substrates. },

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Many programs for aligning short sequencing reads to a reference genome have been developed in the last 2 years. Most of them are very efficient for short reads but inefficient or not applicable for reads {\textgreater}200 bp because the algorithms are heavily and specifically tuned for short queries with low sequencing error rate. However, some sequencing platforms already produce longer reads and others are expected to become available soon. For longer reads, hashing-based software such as BLAT and SSAHA2 remain the only choices. Nonetheless, these methods are substantially slower than short-read aligners in terms of aligned bases per unit time. RESULTS: We designed and implemented a new algorithm, Burrows-Wheeler Aligner's Smith-Waterman Alignment (BWA-SW), to align long sequences up to 1 Mb against a large sequence database (e.g. the human genome) with a few gigabytes of memory. The algorithm is as accurate as SSAHA2, more accurate than BLAT, and is several to tens of times faster than both. AVAILABILITY: http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net},

abstract = {Kataegis is a mutational process observed in ∼55{\%} of breast tumors that results in hypermutation in localized genomic regions. Using whole-genome sequence data of 97 tumors, we examined the distribution of kataegis loci, showing that these somatic mutations are over-represented on chromosomes 8, 17, and 22 and enriched in genic regions and active chromatin elements. We show that tumors harboring kataegis are associated with transcriptome-wide expression changes consistent with low invasive potential. We exploit the kataegis expression signature to predict kataegis status in 412 breast cancers with transcriptome but not whole-genome sequence data and show that kataegis loci are enriched in high-grade, HER2(+) tumors in patients diagnosed with breast cancer at an older age and who have a later age at death. Our study demonstrates that kataegis loci are associated with important clinical features in breast cancer and may serve as a marker of good prognosis. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2016 The Authors.

- Conveys large amount of information through both vertical and horizontal lines on plot.

Drawbacks:
- Can be tricky to interpret
- Point congestion (i.e. imagine what happens when many points get stacked onto a single pixel).
- logarithmic y-axis may obscure interpretation.

Interesting points:

abstract = {A major promise of genomic research is information that can transform health care and public health through earlier diagnosis, more effective prevention and treatment of disease, and avoidance of drug side effects. Although there is interest in the early adoption of emerging genomic applications in cancer prevention and treatment, there are substantial evidence gaps that are further compounded by the difficulties of designing adequately powered studies to generate this evidence, thus limiting the uptake of these tools into clinical practice. Comparative effectiveness research (CER) is intended to generate evidence on the "real-world" effectiveness compared with existing standards of care so informed decisions can be made to improve health care. Capitalizing on funding opportunities from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, the National Cancer Institute funded seven research teams to conduct CER in genomic and precision medicine and sponsored a workshop on CER on May 30, 2012, in Bethesda, Maryland. This report highlights research findings from those research teams, challenges to conducting CER, the barriers to implementation in clinical practice, and research priorities and opportunities in CER in genomic and precision medicine. Workshop participants strongly emphasized the need for conducting CER for promising molecularly targeted therapies, developing and supporting an integrated clinical network for open-access resources, supporting bioinformatics and computer science research, providing training and education programs in CER, and conducting research in economic and decision modeling.},

We sequenced 25 spatially distinct regions from seven operable NSCLCs and found evidence of branched evolution, with driver mutations arising before and after subclonal diversification. There was pronounced intratumor heterogeneity in copy number alterations, translocations, and mutations associated with APOBEC cytidine deaminase activity. Despite maintained carcinogen exposure, tumors from smokers showed a relative decrease in smoking-related mutations over time, accompanied by an increase in APOBEC-associated mutations. In tumors from former smokers, genome-doubling occurred within a smoking-signature context before subclonal diversification, which suggested that a long period of tumor latency had preceded clinical detection. The regionally separated driver mutations, coupled with the relentless and heterogeneous nature of the genome instability processes, are likely to confound treatment success in NSCLC.

Standard chemotherapy has long been the mainstay of cancer medical management, and despite vast efforts towards more targeted and personalized drug therapy, many cancers remain refractory to treatment, with high rates of relapse and poor prognosis. Recent dramatic immunotherapy clinical trials have demonstrated that engineering T-cells with chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) to target CD19 can lead to complete remission in relapsed or refractory B-cell malignancies, generating a great deal of enthusiasm in the field. Here we provide a comprehensive overview of the history of adoptive T-cell therapy, including CARs, in solid tumors as well as hematologic malignancies. CAR therapy has the potential to fundamentally transform cancer treatment with specific and even personalized targeting of tissue- and tumor-specific antigens. However, before CARs become standard first-line treatment modalities, critical issues regarding efficacy, combinatorial regimens, and mechanisms of treatment failure and toxicity will need to be addressed. },

abstract = {Squamous cell carcinoma of the anal canal (SCCA) is a rare gastrointestinal malignancy with an increasing annual incidence globally. The majority of cases are linked to prior infection with the human papillomavirus (HPV). For patients with metastatic SCCA, no consensus standard treatment exists. Identification of relevant targeted agents as novel therapeutic approaches for metastatic SCCA has been limited by a lack of comprehensive molecular profiling. We performed whole-exome sequencing on tumor-normal pairs from 24 patients with metastatic SCCA. Tumor tissue from 17 additional patients was analyzed using a 263-gene panel as a validation cohort. Gene expression profiling was performed on available frozen tissue to assess for differential expression patterns. Based on these findings, patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of SCCA were generated to test targeted therapies against PI3K and EGFR. Despite a low mutation burden, mutations in PIK3CA, MLL2, and MLL3 were among the most commonly mutated genes. An association between TP53 mutations and HPV-negative SCCA tumors was observed. Gene expression analysis suggested distinct tumor subpopulations harboring PIK3CA mutations and for which HPV had integrated into the host genome. In vivo studies demonstrated improvement with anti-EGFR treatment. Gene mutation frequencies, tumor mutation burden, and gene expression patterns for metastatic SCCA appear similar to other HPV-associated malignancies.Implications: This first comprehensive genomic characterization for patients with metastatic SCCA provides further rationale for the integration of SCCA into the development of novel targeted therapies across HPV-related cancers.

Recently, a mutational signature was associated with failure of double-strand DNA break repair by homologous recombination based on its high mutational burden in samples harbouring BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations. In pancreatic cancer, all responders to platinum therapy exhibit this mutational signature including a sample that lacked any defects in BRCA1 or BRCA2. Here, we examine 10,250 cancer genomes across 36 types of cancer and demonstrate that, in addition to breast, ovarian and pancreatic cancers, gastric cancer is another cancer type that exhibits this mutational signature. Our results suggest that 7-12{\%} of gastric cancers have defective double-strand DNA break repair by homologous recombination and may benefit from either platinum therapy or PARP inhibitors.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues represent a valuable source for biomarker studies and clinical routine diagnostics. However, they suffer from degradation of nucleic acids due to the fixation process. Since genetic and epigenetic studies usually require PCR amplification, this degradation hampers its use significantly, impairing PCR robustness or necessitating short amplicons. In routine laboratory medicine a highly robust PCR performance is mandatory for the clinical utility of genetic and epigenetic biomarkers. Therefore, methods to improve PCR performance using DNA from FFPE tissue are highly desired and of wider interest.  The effect of template DNA derived from FFPE tissues on PCR performance was investigated by means of qPCR and conventional PCR using PCR fragments of different sizes. DNA fragmentation was analyzed via agarose gel electrophoresis.  This study showed that poor PCR amplification was partly caused by inhibition of the DNA polymerase by fragmented DNA from FFPE tissue and not only due to the absence of intact template molecules of sufficient integrity. This PCR inhibition was successfully minimized by increasing the polymerase concentration, dNTP concentration and PCR elongation time thereby allowing for the robust amplification of larger amplicons. This was shown for genomic template DNA as well as for bisulfite-converted template DNA required for DNA methylation analyses.  In conclusion, PCR using DNA from FFPE tissue suffers from inhibition which can be alleviated by adaptation of the PCR conditions, therefore allowing for a significant improvement of PCR performance with regard to variability and the generation of larger amplicons. The presented solutions to overcome this PCR inhibition are of tremendous value for clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Discovery of novel splicing from RNA sequence data remains a critical and exciting focus of transcriptomics, but reduced alignment power impedes expression quantification of novel splice junctions.
RESULTS: Here, we profile performance characteristics of two-pass alignment, which separates splice junction discovery from quantification. Per sample, across a variety of transcriptome sequencing datasets, two-pass alignment improved quantification of at least 94{\%} of simulated novel splice junctions, and provided as much as 1.7-fold deeper median read depth over those splice junctions. We further demonstrate that two-pass alignment works by increasing alignment of reads to splice junctions by short lengths, and that potential alignment errors are readily identifiable by simple classification. Taken together, two-pass alignment promises to advance quantification and discovery of novel splicing events.

AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Two-pass alignment was implemented here as sequential alignment, genome indexing, and re-alignment steps with STAR. Full parameters are provided in Supplementary Table 2.

abstract = {Reactivation of telomerase has been implicated in human tumorigenesis, but the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here we report the presence of recurrent somatic mutations in the TERT promoter in cancers of the central nervous system (43{\%}), bladder (59{\%}), thyroid (follicular cell-derived, 10{\%}) and skin (melanoma, 29{\%}). In thyroid cancers, the presence of TERT promoter mutations (when occurring together with BRAF mutations) is significantly associated with higher TERT mRNA expression, and in glioblastoma we find a trend for increased telomerase expression in cases harbouring TERT promoter mutations. Both in thyroid cancers and glioblastoma, TERT promoter mutations are significantly associated with older age of the patients. Our results show that TERT promoter mutations are relatively frequent in specific types of human cancers, where they lead to enhanced expression of telomerase.},

Loss of MAF or MAFB expression results in decreased APOBEC3B and APOBEC4 expression, indicating a transcriptional control mechanism.

Although driver mutations were the main focus of cancer research for a long time, passenger mutational signatures, the imprints of DNA damage and DNA repair processes that have been oper-ative during tumorigenesis, are also biologically illuminating. This review is a chronicle of how the concept of mutational signatures arose and brings the reader up-to-date on this field, particularly in breast cancer. Mutational signatures have now been advanced to include mutational processes that involve rearrangements, and novel cancer biological insights have been gained through studying these in great detail. Furthermore, there are efforts to take this field into the clinical sphere. If validated, mutational signatures could thus form an additional weapon in the arsenal of cancer precision diagnostics and therapeutic stratification in the modern war against cancer.},

abstract = {Major international projects are underway that are aimed at creating a comprehensive catalogue of all the genes responsible for the initiation and progression of cancer. These studies involve the sequencing of matched tumour-normal samples followed by mathematical analysis to identify those genes in which mutations occur more frequently than expected by random chance. Here we describe a fundamental problem with cancer genome studies: as the sample size increases, the list of putatively significant genes produced by current analytical methods burgeons into the hundreds. The list includes many implausible genes (such as those encoding olfactory receptors and the muscle protein titin), suggesting extensive false-positive findings that overshadow true driver events. We show that this problem stems largely from mutational heterogeneity and provide a novel analytical methodology, MutSigCV, for resolving the problem. We apply MutSigCV to exome sequences from 3,083 tumour-normal pairs and discover extraordinary variation in mutation frequency and spectrum within cancer types, which sheds light on mutational processes and disease aetiology, and in mutation frequency across the genome, which is strongly correlated with DNA replication timing and also with transcriptional activity. By incorporating mutational heterogeneity into the analyses, MutSigCV is able to eliminate most of the apparent artefactual findings and enable the identification of genes truly associated with cancer.},

Of the multiple steps in tumor progression, those that are sunlight-related would be revealed if they contained mutations specific to UV. In a series of New England and Swedish patients, we find that 14/24 (58{\%}) of invasive squamous cell carcinomas of the skin contain mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor gene, each altering the amino acid sequence. Involvement of UV light in these p53 mutations is indicated by the presence in three of the tumors of a CC----TT double-base change, which is only known to be induced by UV. UV is also implicated by a UV-like occurrence of mutations exclusively at dipyrimidine sites, including a high frequency of C----T substitutions. p53 mutations in internal malignancies do not show these UV-specific mutations. The dipyrimidine specificity also implicates dipyrimidine photoproducts containing cytosine as oncogenic photoproducts. We believe these results identify a carcinogen-related step in a gene involved in the subsequent human cancer.},

abstract = {Multifocal breast cancer (MFBC), defined as multiple synchronous unilateral lesions of invasive breast cancer, is relatively frequent and has been associated with more aggressive features than unifocal cancer. Here, we aimed to investigate the genomic heterogeneity between MFBC lesions sharing similar histopathological parameters. Characterization of different lesions from 36 patients with ductal MFBC involved the identification of non-silent coding mutations in 360 protein-coding genes (171 tumour and 36 matched normal samples). We selected only patients with lesions presenting the same grade, ER, and HER2 status. Mutations were classified as 'oncogenic' in the case of recurrent substitutions reported in COSMIC or truncating mutations affecting tumour suppressor genes. All mutations identified in a given patient were further interrogated in all samples from that patient through deep resequencing using an orthogonal platform. Whole-genome rearrangement screen was further conducted in 8/36 patients. Twenty-four patients (67{\%}) had substitutions/indels shared by all their lesions, of which 11 carried the same mutations in all lesions, and 13 had lesions with both common and private mutations. Three-quarters of those 24 patients shared oncogenic variants. The remaining 12 patients (33{\%}) did not share any substitution/indels, with inter-lesion heterogeneity observed for oncogenic mutation(s) in genes such as PIK3CA, TP53, GATA3, and PTEN. Genomically heterogeneous lesions tended to be further apart in the mammary gland than homogeneous lesions. Genome-wide analyses of a limited number of patients identified a common somatic background in all studied MFBCs, including those with no mutation in common between the lesions. To conclude, as the number of molecular targeted therapies increases and trials driven by genomic screening are ongoing, our findings highlight the presence of genomic inter-lesion heterogeneity in one-third, despite similar pathological features. This implies that deeper molecular characterization of all MFBC lesions is warranted for the adequate management of those cancers. {\textcopyright} 2015 The Authors.

A subset of these somatic alterations, termed driver mutations, confer selective growth advantage and are implicated in cancer development, whereas the remainder are passengers. Here we have sequenced the genomes of a malignant melanoma and a lymphoblastoid cell line from the same person, providing the first comprehensive catalogue of somatic mutations from an individual cancer. The catalogue provides remarkable insights into the forces that have shaped this cancer genome. The dominant mutational signature reflects DNA damage due to ultraviolet light exposure, a known risk factor for malignant melanoma, whereas the uneven distribution of mutations across the genome, with a lower prevalence in gene footprints, indicates that DNA repair has been preferentially deployed towards transcribed regions. The results illustrate the power of a cancer genome sequence to reveal traces of the DNA damage, repair, mutation and selection processes that were operative years before the cancer became symptomatic.},

abstract = {Cisplatin reacts with DNA, and thereby likely generates a characteristic pattern of somatic mutations, called a mutational signature. Despite the widespread use of cisplatin in cancer treatment and its role in contributing to secondary malignancies, its mutational signature has not been delineated. Delineation of the mutational signature of cisplatin would enable identification of cisplatin-induced secondary malignancies, and consequently improve screening for secondary malignancies after cisplatin chemotherapy. We sequenced the whole genomes of 6 independent clones of cisplatin-exposed MCF-10A cells, and delineated the patterns of single- and di-nucleotide mutations in each clone in terms of flanking sequence context, transcription strand bias, and other characteristics. We used statistical tests and non-negative matrix factorization to search for these signatures in hepatocellular carcinomas and esophageal adenocarcinomas. All clones showed highly consistent patterns of single- and di-nucleotide substitutions in the contexts of immediately flanking bases. The proportion of dinucleotide substitutions was high: 7.3{\%} of single nucleotide substitutions were part of dinucleotide substitutions, presumably due to cisplatin's propensity to form intra strand and inter-strand crosslinks between purine bases in DNA. Statistical and non-negative-factorization-based analyses identified likely cisplatin exposure in 8 hepatocellular carcinomas and 2 esophageal adenocarcinomas. All hepatocellular carcinomas for which clinical data were available and both esophageal cancers indeed had histories of prior cisplatin treatment. We experimentally delineated the mutational signature of cisplatin based on the patterns of the single nucleotide and dinucleotide substitutions. This signature enabled us to detect previous cisplatin exposure in human hepatocellular carcinomas and esophageal adenocarcinomas with high confidence.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The major aim of this study was to evaluate the prognosis of diabetic gastroparesis. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Between 1984 and 1989, 86 outpatients with diabetes (66 type 1, 20 type 2; 40 male, 46 female) underwent assessment of solid and liquid gastric emptying and esophageal transit (by scintigraphy), gastrointestinal symptoms (by questionnaire), autonomic nerve function (by cardiovascular reflex tests), and glycemic control (by HbAlc and blood glucose concentrations during gastric emptying measurement). These patients were followed up in 1998. RESULTS: Of the 86 patients, solid gastric emptying (percentage of retention at 100 min) was delayed in 48 (56{\%}) patients and liquid emptying (50{\%} emptying time) was delayed in 24 (28{\%}) patients. At follow-up in 1998, 62 patients were known to be alive, 21 had died, and 3 were lost to follow-up. In the group who had died, duration of diabetes (P = 0.048), score for autonomic neuropathy (P = 0.046), and esophageal transit (P = 0.032) were greater than in those patients who were alive, but there were no differences in gastric emptying between the two groups. Of the 83 patients who could be followed up, 32 of the 45 patients (71{\%}) with delayed solid emptying and 18 of the 24 patients (75{\%}) with delay in liquid emptying were alive. After adjustment for the effects of other factors that showed a relationship with the risk of dying, there was no significant relationship between either gastric emptying or esophageal transit and death. CONCLUSIONS: In this relatively large cohort of outpatients with diabetes, there was no evidence that gastroparesis was associated with a poor prognosis. },

abstract = {Atypical lipomatous tumor (ALT), well differentiated liposarcoma (WDLS) and dedifferentiated liposarcoma (DDLS) are cytogenetically characterized by near-diploid karyotypes with no or few other aberrations than supernumerary ring or giant marker chromosomes, although DDLS tend to have somewhat more complex rearrangements. In contrast, pleomorphic liposarcomas (PLS) have highly aberrant and heterogeneous karyotypes. The ring and giant marker chromosomes contain discontinuous amplicons, in particular including multiple copies of the target genes CDK4, HMGA2 and MDM2 from 12q, but often also sequences from other chromosomes. The present study presents a DDLS with an atypical hypertriploid karyotype without any ring or giant marker chromosomes. SNP array analyses revealed amplification of almost the entire 5p and discontinuous amplicons of 12q including the classical target genes, in particular CDK4. In addition, amplicons from 1q, 3q, 7p, 9p, 11q and 20q, covering from 2 to 14 Mb, were present. FISH analyses showed that sequences from 5p and 12q were scattered, separately or together, over more than 10 chromosomes of varying size. At RNA sequencing, significantly elevated expression, compared to myxoid liposarcomas, was seen for TRIO and AMACR in 5p and of CDK4, HMGA2 and MDM2 in 12q. The observed pattern of scattered amplification does not show the characteristics of chromothripsis, but is novel and differs from the well known cytogenetic manifestations of amplification, i.e., double minutes, homogeneously staining regions and ring chromosomes. Possible explanations for this unusual distribution of amplified sequences might be the mechanism of alternative lengthening of telomeres that is frequently active in DDLS and events associated with telomere crisis.},

However, epigenetic, transcriptional, proteomic, posttranslational modifications, metabolic, and environmental factors influence a patient's response to disease and treatment. As more analytical and diagnostic techniques are incorporated into medical practice, the personalized medicine initiative transitions to precision medicine giving a holistic view of the patient's condition. The high accuracy and sensitivity of mass spectrometric analysis of proteomes is well suited for the incorporation of proteomics into precision medicine. This review begins with an overview of the advance to precision medicine and the current state of the art in technology and instrumentation for mass spectrometry analysis. Thereafter, it focuses on the benefits and potential uses for personalized proteomic analysis in the diagnostic and treatment of individual patients. In conclusion, it calls for a synthesis between basic science and clinical researchers with practicing clinicians to design proteomic studies to generate meaningful and applicable translational medicine. As clinical proteomics is just beginning to come out of its infancy, this overview is provided for the new initiate.},

abstract = {The Morris water maze (MWM) is a test of spatial learning for rodents that relies on distal cues to navigate from start locations around the perimeter of an open swimming arena to locate a submerged escape platform. Spatial learning is assessed across repeated trials and reference memory is determined by preference for the platform area when the platform is absent. Reversal and shift trials enhance the detection of spatial impairments. Trial-dependent, latent and discrimination learning can be assessed using modifications of the basic protocol. Search-to-platform area determines the degree of reliance on spatial versus non-spatial strategies. Cued trials determine whether performance factors that are unrelated to place learning are present. Escape from water is relatively immune from activity or body mass differences, making it ideal for many experimental models. The MWM has proven to be a robust and reliable test that is strongly correlated with hippocampal synaptic plasticity and NMDA receptor function. We present protocols for performing variants of the MWM test, from which results can be obtained from individual animals in as few as 6 days. },

abstract = {Investigating genomic structural variants at basepair resolution is crucial for understanding their formation mechanisms. We identify and analyse 8,943 deletion breakpoints in 1,092 samples from the 1000 Genomes Project. We find breakpoints have more nearby SNPs and indels than the genomic average, likely a consequence of relaxed selection. By investigating the correlation of breakpoints with DNA methylation, Hi-C interactions, and histone marks and the substitution patterns of nucleotides near them, we find that breakpoints with the signature of non-allelic homologous recombination (NAHR) are associated with open chromatin. We hypothesize that some NAHR deletions occur without DNA replication and cell division, in embryonic and germline cells. In contrast, breakpoints associated with non-homologous (NH) mechanisms often have sequence microinsertions, templated from later replicating genomic sites, spaced at two characteristic distances from the breakpoint. These microinsertions are consistent with template-switching events and suggest a particular spatiotemporal configuration for DNA during the events. },

The consequent increased demand for somatic variant analysis of paired samples requires methods specialized to model this problem so as to sensitively call variants at any practical level of tumor impurity.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We describe Strelka, a method for somatic SNV and small indel detection from sequencing data of matched tumor-normal samples. The method uses a novel Bayesian approach which represents continuous allele frequencies for both tumor and normal samples, while leveraging the expected genotype structure of the normal. This is achieved by representing the normal sample as a mixture of germline variation with noise, and representing the tumor sample as a mixture of the normal sample with somatic variation. A natural consequence of the model structure is that sensitivity can be maintained at high tumor impurity without requiring purity estimates. We demonstrate that the method has superior accuracy and sensitivity on impure samples compared with approaches based on either diploid genotype likelihoods or general allele-frequency tests.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nAVAILABILITY: The Strelka workflow source code is available at ftp://strelka@ftp.illumina.com/.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONTACT: csaunders@illumina.com},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Over the past few years, the alkylating agent temozolomide (TMZ) has become the standard-of-care therapy for patients with glioblastoma, the most common brain tumor. Recently, large-scale cancer genome sequencing efforts have identified a hypermutation phenotype and inactivating MSH6 mismatch repair gene mutations in recurrent, post-TMZ glioblastomas, particularly those growing more rapidly during TMZ treatment. This study aimed to clarify the timing and role of MSH6 mutations in mediating glioblastoma TMZ resistance. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: MSH6 sequence and microsatellite instability (MSI) status were determined in matched pre- and post-chemotherapy glioblastomas identified by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) as having post-treatment MSH6 mutations. TMZ-resistant lines were derived in vitro via selective growth under TMZ and the MSH6 gene was sequenced in resistant clones. The role of MSH6 inactivation in mediating resistance was explored using lentiviral shRNA knockdown and MSH6 reconstitution. RESULTS: MSH6 mutations were confirmed in post-treatment TCGA glioblastomas but absent in matched pre-treatment tumors. The post-treatment hypermutation phenotype displayed a signature bias toward CpC transitions and was not associated with MSI. In vitro modeling via exposure of an MSH6-wildtype glioblastoma line to TMZ resulted in resistant clones; one clone showed an MSH6 mutation, Thr1219Ile, that had been independently noted in two treated TCGA glioblastomas. Knockdown of MSH6 in the glioblastoma line U251 increased resistance to TMZ cytotoxicity and reconstitution restored cytotoxicity in MSH6-null glioma cells. CONCLUSIONS: MSH6 mutations are selected for in glioblastomas during TMZ therapy both in vitro and in vivo, and are causally associated with TMZ resistance. },

Recently, a number of investigators have performed MWI at field strengths higher than 1.5 T. Our goal was to determine if myelin water imaging at increased SNR, arising from the use of a small bore 7 T MR system with optimized coil geometry, enables the production of superior myelin water maps with increased spatial detail and enables better correlations with histology. Ten formalin-fixed MS brain samples underwent a 32-echo T(2) relaxation experiment which measured myelin water fraction (MWF) on a 7-T animal MRI scanner. MWF correlated strongly qualitatively and quantitatively with luxol fast blue staining for myelin [mean (range): R(2)=0.78 (0.56-0.95), p{\textless}0.0001]. The quality and detail of 7 T myelin water maps were far superior to that previously seen at 1.5 T, allowing for visualization of fine structures such as the normal prominent myelination of the deeper cortical layers, the alveus of the hippocampus and rings of preserved myelin in a concentric Balo's lesion. 7 T imaging will allow detailed assessment of myelin pathology to a degree not possible with lower field strengths.},

We have now expanded this study to evaluate the efficacy of PD-1 blockade in patients with advanced mismatch repair-deficient cancers across 12 different tumor types. Objective radiographic responses were observed in 53{\%} of patients, and complete responses were achieved in 21{\%} of patients. Responses were durable, with median progression-free survival and overall survival still not reached. Functional analysis in a responding patient demonstrated rapid in vivo expansion of neoantigen-specific T cell clones that were reactive to mutant neopeptides found in the tumor. These data support the hypothesis that the large proportion of mutant neoantigens in mismatch repair-deficient cancers make them sensitive to immune checkpoint blockade, regardless of the cancers' tissue of origin.},

abstract = {White matter tracts are highly vulnerable to damage from impact-acceleration forces of traumatic brain injury (TBI). Mild TBI is characterized by a low density of traumatic axonal injury, whereas associated myelin pathology is relatively unexplored. We examined the progression of white matter pathology in mice after mild TBI with traumatic axonal injury localized in the corpus callosum. Adult mice received a closed-skull impact and were analyzed from 3 days to 6 weeks post-TBI/sham surgery. At all times post-TBI, electron microscopy revealed degenerating axons distributed among intact fibers in the corpus callosum. Intact axons exhibited significant demyelination at 3 days followed by evidence of remyelination at 1 week. Accordingly, bromodeoxyuridine pulse-chase labeling demonstrated the generation of new oligodendrocytes, identified by myelin proteolipid protein messenger RNA expression, at 3 days post-TBI. Overall oligodendrocyte populations, identified by immunohistochemical staining for CC1 and/or glutathione S-transferase pi, were similar between TBI and sham mice by 2 weeks. Excessively long myelin figures, similar to redundant myelin sheaths, were a significant feature at all post-TBI time points. At 6 weeks post-TBI, microglial activation and astrogliosis were localized to areas of axon and myelin pathology. These studies show that demyelination, remyelination, and excessive myelin are components of white matter degeneration and recovery in mild TBI with traumatic axonal injury.},

There was pronounced intratumor heterogeneity in copy number alterations, translocations, and mutations associated with APOBEC cytidine deaminase activity. Despite maintained carcinogen exposure, tumors from smokers showed a relative decrease in smoking-related mutations over time, accompanied by an increase in APOBEC-associated mutations. In tumors from former smokers, genome-doubling occurred within a smoking-signature context before subclonal diversification, which suggested that a long period of tumor latency had preceded clinical detection. The regionally separated driver mutations, coupled with the relentless and heterogeneous nature of the genome instability processes, are likely to confound treatment success in NSCLC.},

abstract = {Breast cancer genomes have revealed a novel form of mutation showers (kataegis) in which multiple same-strand substitutions at C:G pairs spaced one to several hundred nucleotides apart are clustered over kilobase-sized regions, often associated with sites of DNA rearrangement. We show kataegis can result from AID/APOBEC-catalysed cytidine deamination in the vicinity of DNA breaks, likely through action on single-stranded DNA exposed during resection. Cancer-like kataegis can be recapitulated by expression of AID/APOBEC family deaminases in yeast where it largely depends on uracil excision, which generates an abasic site for strand breakage. Localized kataegis can also be nucleated by an I-SceI-induced break. Genome-wide patterns of APOBEC3-catalyzed deamination in yeast reveal APOBEC3B and 3A as the deaminases whose mutational signatures are most similar to those of breast cancer kataegic mutations. Together with expression and functional assays, the results implicate APOBEC3B/A in breast cancer hypermutation and give insight into the mechanism of kataegis.

Robust methods to construct comprehensive cistrome and epicistrome maps are critical for elucidating complex transcriptional networks that underlie growth, behavior, and disease. Here, we describe DNA affinity purification sequencing (DAP-seq), a high-throughput TF binding site discovery method that interrogates genomic DNA with in-vitro-expressed TFs. Using DAP-seq, we defined the Arabidopsis cistrome by resolving motifs and peaks for 529 TFs. Because genomic DNA used in DAP-seq retains 5-methylcytosines, we determined that {\textgreater}75{\%} (248/327) of Arabidopsis TFs surveyed were methylation sensitive, a property that strongly impacts the epicistrome landscape.

METHODS: We reviewed the completed, ongoing and planned clinical trials evaluating anti-VEGF strategies for malignant glioma patients. RESULTS/CONCLUSIONS: Recent studies incorporating anti-VEGF agents plus cytotoxic therapy among recurrent malignant glioma patients have achieved unprecedented improvements in radiographic response, time to progression and survival. Furthermore, acceptable toxicity was observed. Hence, a major current focus in neuro-oncology is to further develop antiangiogenic strategies for this desperate patient population. },

Signatures of these processes in cancer genomes may explain cancer etiology and could hold diagnostic and prognostic value. We developed a strategy that can be used to explore the origin of cancer-associated mutational signatures. We used CRISPR-Cas9 technology to delete key DNA repair genes in human colon organoids, followed by delayed subcloning and whole-genome sequencing. We found that mutation accumulation in organoids deficient in the mismatch repair gene MLH1 is driven by replication errors and accurately models the mutation profiles observed in mismatch repair-deficient colorectal cancers. Application of this strategy to the cancer predisposition gene NTHL1, which encodes a base excision repair protein, revealed a mutational footprint (signature 30) previously observed in a breast cancer cohort. We show that signature 30 can arise from germline NTHL1 mutations.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Cancer cell genomes acquire several genetic alterations during somatic evolution from a normal cell type. The relative order in which these mutations accumulate and contribute to cell fitness is affected by epistatic interactions. Inferring their evolutionary history is challenging because of the large number of mutations acquired by cancer cells as well as the presence of unknown epistatic interactions.
RESULTS: We developed Bayesian Mutation Landscape (BML), a probabilistic approach for reconstructing ancestral genotypes from tumor samples for much larger sets of genes than previously feasible. BML infers the likely sequence of mutation accumulation for any set of genes that is recurrently mutated in tumor samples. When applied to tumor samples from colorectal, glioblastoma, lung and ovarian cancer patients, BML identifies the diverse evolutionary scenarios involved in tumor initiation and progression in greater detail, but broadly in agreement with prior results.

abstract = {Isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) enzymes have recently become a focal point for research aimed at understanding the biology of glioma. IDH1 and IDH2 are mutated in 50{\%}–80{\%} of astrocytomas, oligodendrogliomas, oligoastrocytomas, and secondary glioblastomas but are seldom mutated in primary glioblastomas. Gliomas with IDH1/2 mutations always harbor other molecular aberrations, such as TP53 mutation or 1p/19q loss. IDH1 and IDH2 mutations may serve as prognostic factors because patients with an IDH-mutated glioma survive significantly longer than those with an IDH–wild-type tumor. However, the molecular pathogenic role of IDH1/2 mutations in the development of gliomas is unclear. The production of 2-hydroxyglutarate and enhanced NADP+ levels in tumor cells with mutant IDH1/2 suggest mechanisms through which these mutations contribute to tumorigenesis. Elucidating the pathogenesis of IDH mutations will improve understanding of the molecular mechanisms of gliomagenesis and may lead to development of a new molecular classification system and novel therapies. },

abstract = {Individuals who inherit mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 are predisposed to breast and ovarian cancers. However, identifying mutations in these large genes by conventional dideoxy sequencing in a clinical testing laboratory is both time consuming and costly, and similar challenges exist for other large genes, or sets of genes, with relevance in the clinical setting. Second-generation sequencing technologies have the potential to improve the efficiency and throughput of clinical diagnostic sequencing, once clinically validated methods become available. We have developed a method for detection of variants based on automated small-amplicon PCR followed by sample pooling and sequencing with a second-generation instrument. To demonstrate the suitability of this method for clinical diagnostic sequencing, we analyzed the coding exons and the intron-exon boundaries of BRCA1 and BRCA2 in 91 hereditary breast cancer patient samples. Our method generated high-quality sequence coverage across all targeted regions, with median coverage greater than 4000-fold for each sample in pools of 24. Sensitive and specific automated variant detection, without false-positive or false-negative results, was accomplished with a standard software pipeline using bwa for sequence alignment and samtools for variant detection. We experimentally derived a minimum threshold of 100-fold sequence depth for confident variant detection. The results demonstrate that this method is suitable for sensitive, automatable, high-throughput sequence variant detection in the clinical laboratory.},

A subset of these somatic alterations, termed driver mutations, confer selective growth advantage and are implicated in cancer development, whereas the remainder are passengers. Here we have sequenced the genomes of a malignant melanoma and a lymphoblastoid cell line from the same person, providing the first comprehensive catalogue of somatic mutations from an individual cancer. The catalogue provides remarkable insights into the forces that have shaped this cancer genome. The dominant mutational signature reflects DNA damage due to ultraviolet light exposure, a known risk factor for malignant melanoma, whereas the uneven distribution of mutations across the genome, with a lower prevalence in gene footprints, indicates that DNA repair has been preferentially deployed towards transcribed regions. The results illustrate the power of a cancer genome sequence to reveal traces of the DNA damage, repair, mutation and selection processes that were operative years before the cancer became symptomatic.},

abstract = {Purpose Secondary somatic BRCA1/2 mutations may restore BRCA1/2 protein in hereditary ovarian carcinomas. In cell lines, BRCA2 restoration mediates resistance to platinum chemotherapy and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors. We assessed primary and recurrent BRCA1/2-mutated ovarian carcinomas to define the frequency of secondary mutations and correlate these changes with clinical outcomes.Methods Neoplastic cells were isolated with laser capture microdissection, and DNA was sequenced at the site of the known germline BRCA1/2 mutation. When secondary mutations were found that restored wild-type sequence, haplotyping was performed using single nucleotide polymorphisms in tumor and paired lymphocyte DNA to rule out retention of the wild-type allele.Results There were 64 primary and 46 recurrent ovarian carcinomas assessed. Thirteen (28.3{\%}) of 46 (95{\%} CI, 17.3{\%} to 42.6{\%}) recurrent carcinomas had a secondary mutation compared with two (3.1{\%}) of 64 (95{\%} CI, 1.0{\%} to 10.7{\%}) primary carcinomas (P = .0003, Fisher's exact test). Twelve (46.2{\%}) of 26 (95{\%} CI, 28.7{\%} to 64.7{\%}) platinum-resistant recurrences had secondary mutations restoring BRCA1/2, compared with one (5.3{\%}) of 19 (95{\%} CI, 1.2{\%} to 24.8{\%}) platinum-sensitive recurrences (P = .003, Fisher's exact test). Six (66.7{\%}) of nine (95{\%} CI, 34.8{\%} to 87.8{\%}) women with prior breast carcinoma had a recurrent carcinoma with a secondary mutation, compared with six (17.1{\%}) of 35 (95{\%} CI, 8.2{\%} to 32.8{\%}) with no history of breast carcinoma (P = .007, Fisher's exact test).Conclusion Secondary somatic mutations that restore BRCA1/2 in carcinomas from women with germline BRCA1/2 mutations predict resistance to platinum chemotherapy and may also predict resistance to PARP inhibitors. These mutations were detectable only in ovarian carcinomas of women whom have had previous chemotherapy, either for ovarian or breast carcinoma. },

abstract = {We performed fine mapping of 39 established type 2 diabetes (T2D) loci in 27,206 cases and 57,574 controls of European ancestry. We identified 49 distinct association signals at these loci, including five mapping in or near KCNQ1. 'Credible sets' of the variants most likely to drive each distinct signal mapped predominantly to noncoding sequence, implying that association with T2D is mediated through gene regulation. Credible set variants were enriched for overlap with FOXA2 chromatin immunoprecipitation binding sites in human islet and liver cells, including at MTNR1B, where fine mapping implicated rs10830963 as driving T2D association. We confirmed that the T2D risk allele for this SNP increases FOXA2-bound enhancer activity in islet- and liver-derived cells. We observed allele-specific differences in NEUROD1 binding in islet-derived cells, consistent with evidence that the T2D risk allele increases islet MTNR1B expression. Our study demonstrates how integration of genetic and genomic information can define molecular mechanisms through which variants underlying association signals exert their effects on disease. },

This analysis was termed an allelotype, in analogy with a karyotype. Three major conclusions were drawn from this analysis: (i) Allelic deletions were remarkably common; one of the alleles of each polymorphic marker tested was lost in at least some tumors, and some tumors lost more than half of their parental alleles. (ii) In addition to allelic deletions, new DNA fragments not present in normal tissue were identified in five carcinomas; these new fragments contained repeated sequences of the variable number of tandem repeat type. (iii) Patients with more than the median percentage of allelic deletions had a considerably worse prognosis than did the other patients, although the size and stage of the primary tumors were very similar in the two groups. In addition to its implications concerning the genetic events underlying tumorigenesis, tumor allelotype may provide a molecular tool for improved estimation of prognosis in patients with colorectal cancer.},

abstract = {In a short hairpin RNA screen for genes that affect AKT phosphorylation, we identified the RAB35 small guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase)-a protein previously implicated in endomembrane trafficking-as a regulator of the phosphatidylinositol 3'-OH kinase (PI3K) pathway. Depletion of RAB35 suppresses AKT phosphorylation in response to growth factors, whereas expression of a dominant active GTPase-deficient mutant of RAB35 constitutively activates the PI3K/AKT pathway. RAB35 functions downstream of growth factor receptors and upstream of PDK1 and mTORC2 and copurifies with PI3K in immunoprecipitation assays. Two somatic RAB35 mutations found in human tumors generate alleles that constitutively activate PI3K/AKT signaling, suppress apoptosis, and transform cells in a PI3K-dependent manner. Furthermore, oncogenic RAB35 is sufficient to drive platelet-derived growth factor receptor $\alpha$ to LAMP2-positive endomembranes in the absence of ligand, suggesting that there may be latent oncogenic potential in dysregulated endomembrane trafficking.

abstract = {A small number of common susceptibility loci have been identified for pancreatic cancer, one of which is marked by rs401681 in the TERT-CLPTM1L gene region on chromosome 5p15.33. Because this region is characterized by low linkage disequilibrium, we sought to identify whether additional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) could be related to pancreatic cancer risk, independently of rs401681. We performed an in-depth analysis of genetic variability of the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) and the telomerase RNA component (TERC) genes, in 5,550 subjects with pancreatic cancer and 7,585 controls from the PANcreatic Disease ReseArch (PANDoRA) and the PanScan consortia. We identified a significant association between a variant in TERT and pancreatic cancer risk (rs2853677, odds ratio = 0.85; 95{\%} confidence interval = 0.80-0.90, p = 8.3 × 10(-8) ). Additional analysis adjusting rs2853677 for rs401681 indicated that the two SNPs are independently associated with pancreatic cancer risk, as suggested by the low linkage disequilibrium between them (r(2)  = 0.07, D' = 0.28). Three additional SNPs in TERT reached statistical significance after correction for multiple testing: rs2736100 (p = 3.0 × 10(-5) ), rs4583925 (p = 4.0 × 10(-5) ) and rs2735948 (p = 5.0 × 10(-5) ). In conclusion, we confirmed that the TERT locus is associated with pancreatic cancer risk, possibly through several independent variants. {\textcopyright} 2015 UICC.},

Patterns of structural variation (variation in chromosomal structure) classified PDACs into 4 subtypes with potential clinical utility: the subtypes were termed stable, locally rearranged, scattered and unstable. A significant proportion harboured focal amplifications, many of which contained druggable oncogenes (ERBB2, MET, FGFR1, CDK6, PIK3R3 and PIK3CA), but at low individual patient prevalence.

abstract = {Background: High mutation burden correlates with response to ICB in UC. Loss of function alterations or epigenetic silencing of MMR genes results in MMR deficient (MMR-D) UC, leading to a microsatellite instability (MSI) mutation signature. We used a CLIA-certified pipeline (MSISensor) to interrogate Next Generation sequencing (NGS) data from UC tumors to identify MMR-D patients (pts). We correlated MMR-D with mutation load and response to ICB. Methods: 447 tumors from 424 UC pts underwent prospective NGS using the MSK-IMPACT exon capture assay and genomic interrogation of microsatellite (MS) sites using MSIsensor, which assesses the number/length of MS within the targeted regions of tumor-normal sample pairs. Loci are considered unstable (somatic) if k-mer distributions are significantly different between tumor and matched normal using a standard multiple testing correction of $\chi$2 p-values. The fraction of unstable sites is reported as an MSIsensor score. MSI high tumors have scores {\textgreater}10 while {\textless}3 are denoted MS stable. Scores from 3-10 were categorized as MS intermediate. Results: Thirteen pts (3{\%}) had an MSI score {\textgreater}10 and a median mutation count of 52 (36.5-73.5) vs 8 (5-13) in 410 non-MMR-D pts (p{\textless}0.01). Ten pts (71{\%}) had upper tract UC. Of 9 pts with germline sequencing performed, 8 (89{\%}) had heritable loss of function mutations in MMR proteins (Lynch syndrome, LS). One pt had a somatic MSH2 mutation. Fifteen pts had MS scores from 3-10: 3 had LS, one a BRCA1 germline alteration, and 9 did not have germline testing available. Two pts with MSI scores {\textless}3 had extremely high mutation loads (213 and 414) and both had POLE mutations. Five pts received ICB therapy for metastatic and all achieved near-complete or complete responses. No MMR-D pt has died at 27 months follow-up vs 125 non-MMR-D pts (p=0.014). Conclusions: The MSI Sensor assay can discriminate MSI high from MMR proficient UC. While rare, MMR-D UC is characterized by a high mutation load, strong association with Lynch syndrome, and durable responses to ICB, similar to data in colon cancer. An MMR-D signature should trigger genetic testing for Lynch syndrome. ICB should be considered early in the treatment course of patients with MMR-D metastatic UC.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is known to be a potent promoter of angiogenesis under both physiological and pathological conditions. Given its role in regulating tumor vascularization, VEGF has been targeted in various cancer treatments, and anti-VEGF therapy has been used clinically for treatment of several types of cancer. Systems biology approaches, particularly computational models, provide insight into the complexity of tumor angiogenesis. These models complement experimental studies and aid in the development of effective therapies targeting angiogenesis.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We developed an experiment-based, molecular-detailed compartment model of VEGF kinetics and transport to investigate the distribution of two major VEGF isoforms (VEGF121 and VEGF165) in the body. The model is applied to predict the dynamics of tumor VEGF and, importantly, to gain insight into how tumor VEGF responds to an intravenous injection of an anti-VEGF agent.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The model predicts that free VEGF in the tumor interstitium is seven to 13 times higher than plasma VEGF and is predominantly in the form of VEGF121 ({\textgreater}70{\%}), predictions that are validated by experimental data. The model also predicts that tumor VEGF can increase or decrease with anti-VEGF treatment depending on tumor microenvironment, pointing to the importance of personalized medicine.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: This computational study suggests that the rate of VEGF secretion by tumor cells may serve as a biomarker to predict the patient population that is likely to respond to anti-VEGF treatment. Thus, the model predictions have important clinical relevance and may aid clinicians and clinical researchers seeking interpretation of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic observations and optimization of anti-VEGF therapies.},

abstract = {Cancer drivers are genomic alterations that provide cells containing them with a selective advantage over their local competitors, whereas neutral passengers do not change the somatic fitness of cells. Cancer-driving mutations are usually discriminated from passenger mutations by their higher degree of recurrence in tumor samples. However, there is increasing evidence that many additional driver mutations may exist that occur at very low frequencies among tumors. This observation has prompted alternative methods for driver detection, including finding groups of mutually exclusive mutations and incorporating prior biological knowledge about gene function or network structure. Dependencies among drivers due to epistatic interactions can also result in low mutation frequencies, but this effect has been ignored in driver detection so far. Here, we present a new computational approach for identifying genomic alterations that occur at low frequencies because they depend on other events. Unlike passengers, these constrained mutations display punctuated patterns of occurrence in time. We test this driver–passenger discrimination approach based on mutation timing in extensive simulation studies, and we apply it to cross-sectional copy number alteration (CNA) data from ovarian cancer, CNA and single-nucleotide variant (SNV) data from breast tumors and SNV data from colorectal cancer. Among the top ranked predicted drivers, we find low-frequency genes that have already been shown to be involved in carcinogenesis, as well as many new candidate drivers. The mutation timing approach is orthogonal and complementary to existing driver prediction methods. It will help identifying from cancer genome data the alterations that drive tumor progression.

abstract = {Given the success of targeted agents in specific populations it is expected that some degree of molecular biomarker testing will become standard of care for many, if not all, cancers. To facilitate this, cancer centers worldwide are experimenting with targeted “panel” sequencing of selected mutations. Recent advances in genomic technology enable the generation of genome-scale data sets for individual patients. Recognizing the risk, inherent in panel sequencing, of failing to detect meaningful somatic alterations, we sought to establish processes to integrate data from whole-genome analysis (WGA) into routine cancer care. Between June 2012 and August 2014, 100 adult patients with incurable cancers consented to participate in the Personalized OncoGenomics (POG) study. Fresh tumor and blood samples were obtained and used for whole-genome and RNA sequencing. Computational approaches were used to identify candidate driver mutations, genes, and pathways. Diagnostic and drug information were then sought based on these candidate “drivers.” Reports were generated and discussed weekly in a multidisciplinary team setting. Other multidisciplinary working groups were assembled to establish guidelines on the interpretation, communication, and integration of individual genomic findings into patient care. Of 78 patients for whom WGA was possible, results were considered actionable in 55 cases. In 23 of these 55 cases, the patients received treatments motivated by WGA. Our experience indicates that a multidisciplinary team of clinicians and scientists can implement a paradigm in which WGA is integrated into the care of late stage cancer patients to inform systemic therapy decisions. },

The portal reduces molecular profiling data from cancer tissues and cell lines into readily understandable genetic, epigenetic, gene expression, and proteomic events. The query interface combined with customized data storage enables researchers to interactively explore genetic alterations across samples, genes, and pathways and, when available in the underlying data, to link these to clinical outcomes. The portal provides graphical summaries of gene-level data from multiple platforms, network visualization and analysis, survival analysis, patient-centric queries, and software programmatic access. The intuitive Web interface of the portal makes complex cancer genomics profiles accessible to researchers and clinicians without requiring bioinformatics expertise, thus facilitating biological discoveries. Here, we provide a practical guide to the analysis and visualization features of the cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics.},

We sequenced the genomes of 57 prostate tumors and matched normal tissues to characterize somatic alterations and to study how they accumulate during oncogenesis and progression. By modeling the genesis of genomic rearrangements, we identified abundant DNA translocations and deletions that arise in a highly interdependent manner. This phenomenon, which we term "chromoplexy," frequently accounts for the dysregulation of prostate cancer genes and appears to disrupt multiple cancer genes coordinately. Our modeling suggests that chromoplexy may induce considerable genomic derangement over relatively few events in prostate cancer and other neoplasms, supporting a model of punctuated cancer evolution. By characterizing the clonal hierarchy of genomic lesions in prostate tumors, we charted a path of oncogenic events along which chromoplexy may drive prostate carcinogenesis.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Olaparib (AZD2281) is a small-molecule, potent oral poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor. We aimed to assess the safety and tolerability of this drug in patients without BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations with advanced triple-negative breast cancer or high-grade serous and/or undifferentiated ovarian cancer.

METHODS: In this phase 2, multicentre, open-label, non-randomised study, women with advanced high-grade serous and/or undifferentiated ovarian carcinoma or triple-negative breast cancer were enrolled and received olaparib 400 mg twice a day. Patients were stratified according to whether they had a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation or not. The primary endpoint was objective response rate by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST). All patients who received treatment were included in the analysis of toxic effects, and patients who had measurable lesions at baseline were included in the primary efficacy analysis. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00679783.

FINDINGS: 91 patients were enrolled (65 with ovarian cancer and 26 breast cancer) and 90 were treated between July 8, 2008, and Sept 24, 2009. In the ovarian cancer cohorts, 64 patients received treatment. 63 patients had target lesions and therefore were evaluable for objective response as per RECIST. In these patients, confirmed objective responses were seen in seven (41{\%}; 95{\%} CI 22-64) of 17 patients with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations and 11 (24{\%}; 14-38) of 46 without mutations. No confirmed objective responses were reported in patients with breast cancer. The most common adverse events were fatigue (45 [70{\%}] of patients with ovarian cancer, 13 [50{\%}] of patients with breast cancer), nausea (42 [66{\%}] and 16 [62{\%}]), vomiting (25 [39{\%}] and nine [35{\%}]), and decreased appetite (23 [36{\%}] and seven [27{\%}]).

INTERPRETATION: Our study suggests that olaparib is a promising treatment for women with ovarian cancer and further assessment of the drug in clinical trials is needed.

We performed whole-genome sequencing of 102 primary PanNETs and defined the genomic events that characterize their pathogenesis. Here we describe the mutational signatures they harbour, including a deficiency in G:C {\textgreater} T:A base excision repair due to inactivation of MUTYH, which encodes a DNA glycosylase. Clinically sporadic PanNETs contain a larger-than-expected proportion of germline mutations, including previously unreported mutations in the DNA repair genes MUTYH, CHEK2 and BRCA2. Together with mutations in MEN1 and VHL, these mutations occur in 17{\%} of patients. Somatic mutations, including point mutations and gene fusions, were commonly found in genes involved in four main pathways: chromatin remodelling, DNA damage repair, activation of mTOR signalling (including previously undescribed EWSR1 gene fusions), and telomere maintenance. In addition, our gene expression analyses identified a subgroup of tumours associated with hypoxia and HIF signalling.},

abstract = {One of the key questions about genomic alterations in cancer is whether they are functional in the sense of contributing to the selective advantage of tumor cells. The frequency with which an alteration occurs might reflect its ability to increase cancer cell growth, or alternatively, enhanced instability of a locus may increase the frequency with which it is found to be aberrant in tumors, regardless of oncogenic impact. Here we've addressed this on a genome-wide scale for cancer-associated focal deletions, which are known to pinpoint both tumor suppressor genes (tumor suppressors) and unstable loci. Based on DNA copy number analysis of over one-thousand human cancers representing ten different tumor types, we observed five loci with focal deletion frequencies above 5{\%}, including the A2BP1 gene at 16p13.3 and the MACROD2 gene at 20p12.1. However, neither RNA expression nor functional studies support a tumor suppressor role for either gene. Further analyses suggest instead that these are sites of increased genomic instability and that they resemble common fragile sites (CFS). Genome-wide analysis revealed properties of CFS-like recurrent deletions that distinguish them from deletions affecting tumor suppressor genes, including their isolation at specific loci away from other genomic deletion sites, a considerably smaller deletion size, and dispersal throughout the affected locus rather than assembly at a common site of overlap. Additionally, CFS-like deletions have less impact on gene expression and are enriched in cell lines compared to primary tumors. We show that loci affected by CFS-like deletions are often distinct from known common fragile sites. Indeed, we find that each tumor tissue type has its own spectrum of CFS-like deletions, and that colon cancers have many more CFS-like deletions than other tumor types. We present simple rules that can pinpoint focal deletions that are not CFS-like and more likely to affect functional tumor suppressors. },

abstract = {Cytotoxic T cells are of central importance in the immune system's response to disease. They recognize defective cells by binding to peptides presented on the cell surface by MHC class I molecules. Peptide binding to MHC molecules is the single most selective step in the Ag-presentation pathway. Therefore, in the quest for T cell epitopes, the prediction of peptide binding to MHC molecules has attracted widespread attention. In the past, predictors of peptide-MHC interactions have primarily been trained on binding affinity data. Recently, an increasing number of MHC-presented peptides identified by mass spectrometry have been reported containing information about peptide-processing steps in the presentation pathway and the length distribution of naturally presented peptides. In this article, we present NetMHCpan-4.0, a method trained on binding affinity and eluted ligand data leveraging the information from both data types. Large-scale benchmarking of the method demonstrates an increase in predictive performance compared with state-of-the-art methods when it comes to identification of naturally processed ligands, cancer neoantigens, and T cell epitopes.},

Utilizing this approach, we report the first detailed analysis of ovarian cancer rearrangements, comparing high-grade serous and clear cell cancers, and these histotypes with other solid cancers. Somatic rearrangements were systematically characterized in eight high-grade serous and five clear cell ovarian cancer genomes and we report here the identification of {\textgreater} 600 somatic rearrangements. Recurrent rearrangements of the transcriptional regulator gene, TSHZ3, were found in three of eight serous cases. Comparison to breast, pancreatic and prostate cancer genomes revealed that a subset of ovarian cancers share a marked tandem duplication phenotype with triple-negative breast cancers. The tandem duplication phenotype was not linked to BRCA1/2 mutation, suggesting that other common mechanisms or carcinogenic exposures are operative. High-grade serous cancers arising in women with germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation showed a high frequency of small chromosomal deletions. These findings indicate that BRCA1/2 germline mutation may contribute to widespread structural change and that other undefined mechanism(s), which are potentially shared with triple-negative breast cancer, promote tandem chromosomal duplications that sculpt the ovarian cancer genome.Copyright {\textcopyright} 2012 Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.

abstract = {MOTIVATION: The enormous amount of short reads generated by the new DNA sequencing technologies call for the development of fast and accurate read alignment programs. A first generation of hash table-based methods has been developed, including MAQ, which is accurate, feature rich and fast enough to align short reads from a single individual. However, MAQ does not support gapped alignment for single-end reads, which makes it unsuitable for alignment of longer reads where indels may occur frequently. The speed of MAQ is also a concern when the alignment is scaled up to the resequencing of hundreds of individuals. RESULTS: We implemented Burrows-Wheeler Alignment tool (BWA), a new read alignment package that is based on backward search with Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT), to efficiently align short sequencing reads against a large reference sequence such as the human genome, allowing mismatches and gaps. BWA supports both base space reads, e.g. from Illumina sequencing machines, and color space reads from AB SOLiD machines. Evaluations on both simulated and real data suggest that BWA is approximately 10-20x faster than MAQ, while achieving similar accuracy. In addition, BWA outputs alignment in the new standard SAM (Sequence Alignment/Map) format. Variant calling and other downstream analyses after the alignment can be achieved with the open source SAMtools software package. AVAILABILITY: http://maq.sourceforge.net.},

abstract = {Although it is widely accepted that most cancers exhibit some degree of intratumour heterogeneity, we are far from understanding the dynamics that operate among subpopulations within tumours. There is growing evidence that cancer cells behave as communities, and increasing attention is now being directed towards the cooperative behaviour of subclones that can influence disease progression. As expected, these interactions can add a greater layer of complexity to therapeutic interventions in heterogeneous tumours, often leading to a poor prognosis. In this Review, we highlight studies that demonstrate such interactions in cancer and postulate ways to overcome them with better-designed therapeutic strategies. },

abstract = {Recent sequencing studies have extensively explored the somatic alterations present in the nuclear genomes of cancers. Although mitochondria control energy metabolism and apoptosis, the origins and impact of cancer-associated mutations in mtDNA are unclear. In this study, we analyzed somatic alterations in mtDNA from 1675 tumors. We identified 1907 somatic substitutions, which exhibited dramatic replicative strand bias, predominantly C {\textgreater} T and A {\textgreater} G on the mitochondrial heavy strand. This strand-asymmetric signature differs from those found in nuclear cancer genomes but matches the inferred germline process shaping primate mtDNA sequence content. A number of mtDNA mutations showed considerable heterogeneity across tumor types. Missense mutations were selectively neutral and often gradually drifted towards homoplasmy over time. In contrast, mutations resulting in protein truncation undergo negative selection and were almost exclusively heteroplasmic. Our findings indicate that the endogenous mutational mechanism has far greater impact than any other external mutagens in mitochondria and is fundamentally linked to mtDNA replication. },

Like human tumors, the response of individual mouse tumors varies, but eventually they all become resistant to the maximum tolerable dose of doxorubicin or docetaxel. The tumors also respond well to cisplatin but do not become resistant, even after multiple treatments in which tumors appear to regrow from a small fraction of surviving cells. Classical biochemical resistance mechanisms, such as up-regulated drug transporters, appear to be responsible for doxorubicin resistance, rather than alterations in drug-damage effector pathways.

abstract = {Gynecological carcinomas are major therapeutic targets of platinum-containing regimens. They may be particularly susceptible to these agents if their origins are related to hereditary breast cancer (BRCA) mutations; this implicates defective DNA repair secondary to inherited alterations in BRCA function. The concept of ‘BRCAness' was introduced by Ashworth and colleagues in order to identify phenotypic changes in sporadic cancer that would lead to analogous treatment susceptibility. In fact, recent analyses of genetic alterations in ovarian cancer have led to further extending this concept to all women with high-grade serous cancer, the predominant form of ovarian cancer arising in association with hereditary mutations in BRCA genes. Presumably, most serous types of cancer of gynecological origin share BRCA dysfunction to some extent. This renders these types of cancer susceptible to platinum and to other DNA-damaging agents, justifying the general inclusion of this histology in trials of new drugs and therapeutic strategies that have shown activity against hereditary cancer. More recently, however, differences in outcome between BRCA mutation carriers vis-{\`{a}}-vis those with no mutations or those with epigenetic or acquired forms of BRCA genes (somatic mutations) in their respective tumors have been identified. These findings raise additional questions on modifiers of ‘BRCAness' and other pathways that appear to contribute to the effects of platinum and other DNA-damaging agents in ovarian cancer. The Cancer Genome Atlas analyses delineate the complexity of genomic alterations in ovarian cancer and other malignancies of Mullerian epithelial origin promising further refinements of the ‘BRCAness' concept. },

Here, we challenge that view by demonstrating that the infection of human dendritic cells (DCs) with a live pathogenic bacteria is associated with rapid and active demethylation at thousands of loci, independent of cell division. We performed an integrated analysis of data on genome-wide DNA methylation, histone mark patterns, chromatin accessibility, and gene expression, before and after infection. We found that infection-induced demethylation rarely occurs at promoter regions and instead localizes to distal enhancer elements, including those that regulate the activation of key immune transcription factors. Active demethylation is associated with extensive epigenetic remodeling, including the gain of histone activation marks and increased chromatin accessibility, and is strongly predictive of changes in the expression levels of nearby genes. Collectively, our observations show that active, rapid changes in DNA methylation in enhancers play a previously unappreciated role in regulating the transcriptional response to infection, even in nonproliferating cells. {\textcopyright} 2015 Pacis et al.; Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.},

We analyzed somatic mutations and DNA methylation in 5243 cancers of types for which tobacco smoking confers an elevated risk. Smoking is associated with increased mutation burdens of multiple distinct mutational signatures, which contribute to different extents in different cancers. One of these signatures, mainly found in cancers derived from tissues directly exposed to tobacco smoke, is attributable to misreplication of DNA damage caused by tobacco carcinogens. Others likely reflect indirect activation of DNA editing by APOBEC cytidine deaminases and of an endogenous clocklike mutational process. Smoking is associated with limited differences in methylation. The results are consistent with the proposition that smoking increases cancer risk by increasing the somatic mutation load, although direct evidence for this mechanism is lacking in some smoking-related cancer types.},

abstract = {We analysed primary breast cancers by genomic DNA copy number arrays, DNA methylation, exome sequencing, messenger RNA arrays, microRNA sequencing and reverse-phase protein arrays. Our ability to integrate information across platforms provided key insights into previously defined gene expression subtypes and demonstrated the existence of four main breast cancer classes when combining data from five platforms, each of which shows significant molecular heterogeneity. Somatic mutations in only three genes (TP53, PIK3CA and GATA3) occurred at .10{\%} incidence across all breast cancers; however, there were numerous subtype-associated and novel gene mutations including the enrichment of specific mutations in GATA3, PIK3CA and MAP3K1 with the luminal A subtype. We identified two novel protein-expression-defined subgroups, possibly produced by stromal/microenvironmental elements, and integrated analyses identified specific signalling pathways dominant in each molecular subtype including a HER2/phosphorylated HER2/EGFR/phosphorylated EGFR signature within the HER2-enriched expression subtype. Comparison of basal-like breast tumours with high-grade serous ovarian tumours showed many molecular commonalities, indicating a related aetiology and similar therapeutic opportunities. The biological finding of the four main breast cancer subtypes caused by different subsets of genetic and epigenetic abnormalities raises the hypothesis that much of the clinically observable plasticity and heterogeneity occurs within, and not across, these major biological subtypes of breast cancer. Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers with greater than 1,300,000 cases and 450,000 deaths each year worldwide. Clinically, this heterogeneous disease is categorized into three basic therapeutic groups. The oestrogen receptor (ER) positive group is the most numerous and diverse, with several genomic tests to assist in predict-ing outcomes for ER 1 patients receiving endocrine therapy 1,2 . The HER2 (also called ERBB2) amplified group 3 is a great clinical success because of effective therapeutic targeting of HER2, which has led to intense efforts to characterize other DNA copy number aberrations 4,5},

Glioblastoma multiforme cancer-initiating cells have been shown to mediate resistance to both chemotherapy and radiation; however, it is unknown to what extent these cells contribute to the profound immunosuppression in glioblastoma multiforme patients and if strategies that alter their differentiation state can reduce this immunosuppression.Experimental Design: We isolated a subpopulation of cells from glioblastoma multiforme that possessed the capacity for self-renewal, formed neurospheres in vitro, were capable of pluripotent differentiation, and could initiate tumors in vivo. The immune phenotype of these cells was characterized including the elaboration of immunosuppressive cytokines and chemokines by ELISA. Functional immunosuppressive properties were characterized based on the inhibition of T-cell proliferation and effector responses, triggering of T-cell apoptosis, and induction of FoxP3+ regulatory T cells. On altering their differentiation state, the immunosuppressive phenotype and functional assays were reevaluated.Results: We found that the cancer-initiating cells markedly inhibited T-cell proliferation and activation, induced regulatory T cells, and triggered T-cell apoptosis that was mediated by B7-H1 and soluble Galectin-3. These immunosuppressive properties were diminished on altering the differentiation of the cancer-initiating cells.Conclusion: Cancer-initiating cells contribute to tumor evasion of the immunosurveillance and approaches that alter the differentiation state may have immunotherapeutic potential.

abstract = {Platinum based therapy is one of the most effectively used chemotherapeutic treatments for cancer. The mechanism of action of platinum compounds is to damage DNA and drive cells into apoptosis. The most commonly used platinum containing agents are cis-diammine-dichloroplatinum (II)], more commonly known as cisplatin, its analogue carboplatin, and oxaliplatin. Cisplatin is used to treat a wide variety of tumours such as ovarian, testicular, head and neck and non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs). In addition, it forms the basis of most combined treatment regimes. Despite this, cisplatin and its analogues are extremely toxic and although some patients benefit substantially from treatment, a large proportion suffer the toxic side effects without any therapeutic benefit. Nucleotide excision repair (NER) is a versatile DNA repair system that recognises DNA damage induced by platinum based therapy. For many years the components of the NER pathway have been studied to determine mRNA and protein expression levels in response or resistance to cisplatin in many forms of cancer; particularly testicular, ovarian and NSCLCs. Despite the consistent finding that over or under expression of subsets of NER proteins and mRNA highly correlate with response to cisplatin, the translation of these findings into the clinical setting has not been forthcoming. This review summarises the results of previous investigations into NER in cisplatin response and clinical trials where the expression of NER proteins were compared to the response to platinum therapies in treatment. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

Here we perform a whole-blood gene expression meta-analysis in 14,983 individuals of European ancestry (including replication) and identify 1,497 genes that are differentially expressed with chronological age. The age-associated genes do not harbor more age-associated CpG-methylation sites than other genes, but are instead enriched for the presence of potentially functional CpG-methylation sites in enhancer and insulator regions that associate with both chronological age and gene expression levels. We further used the gene expression profiles to calculate the 'transcriptomic age' of an individual, and show that differences between transcriptomic age and chronological age are associated with biological features linked to ageing, such as blood pressure, cholesterol levels, fasting glucose, and body mass index. The transcriptomic prediction model adds biological relevance and complements existing epigenetic prediction models, and can be used by others to calculate transcriptomic age in external cohorts. },

These processes mark the genome, such that a cancer's life history is encrypted in the somatic mutations present. We developed algorithms to decipher this narrative and applied them to 21 breast cancers. Mutational processes evolve across a cancer's lifespan, with many emerging late but contributing extensive genetic variation. Subclonal diversification is prominent, and most mutations are found in just a fraction of tumor cells. Every tumor has a dominant subclonal lineage, representing more than 50{\%} of tumor cells. Minimal expansion of these subclones occurs until many hundreds to thousands of mutations have accumulated, implying the existence of long-lived, quiescent cell lineages capable of substantial proliferation upon acquisition of enabling genomic changes. Expansion of the dominant subclone to an appreciable mass may therefore represent the final rate-limiting step in a breast cancer's development, triggering diagnosis. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

The primary goal is to be able to capture any data point related to patient characteristics, disease factors, treatment details and survivorship, from the point of diagnosis onwards. Through existing and novel data-mining techniques, OaSIS will support unique population based research activities by promoting collaborative interactions between the research centre, clinical activities at the cancer treatment centres and other institutions. This will also facilitate initiatives to improve patient outcomes, decision support in achieving operational efficiencies and an environment that supports knowledge generation.},

When operating normally, the MUTYH DNA glycosylase prevents 8-oxoguanine-related mutagenesis by excising the incorporated adenine. Biallelic MUTYH mutations impair this enzymatic function and are associated with colorectal cancer (CRC) in MUTYH-Associated Polyposis (MAP) syndrome. Here, we perform whole-exome sequencing that reveals a modest mutator phenotype in MAP CRCs compared to sporadic CRC stem cell lines or bulk tumours. The excess G:CN T:A transversion mutations in MAP CRCs exhibits a novel mutational signature, termed Signature 36, with a strong sequence dependence. The MUTYH mutational signature reflecting persistent 8-oxoG:A mismatches occurs frequently in the APC, KRAS, PIK3CA, FAT4, TP53, FAT1, AMER1, KDM6A, SMAD4 and SMAD2 genes that are associated with CRC.

abstract = {Tumor genomes are mosaics of somatic structural variants (SVs) that may contribute to the activation of oncogenes or inactivation of tumor suppressors, for example, by altering gene copy number amplitude. However, there are multiple other ways in which SVs can modulate transcription, but the general impact of such events on tumor transcriptional output has not been systematically de-termined. Here we use whole-genome sequencing data to map SVs across 600 tumors and 18 cancers, and investigate the relationship between SVs, copy number alterations (CNAs), and mRNA expression. We find that 34{\%} of CNA breakpoints can be clarified structurally and that most amplifications are due to tandem duplications. We observe frequent swapping of strong and weak promoters in the context of gene fusions, and find that this has a measurable global impact on mRNA levels. Interestingly, several long noncoding RNAs were strongly activated by this mechanism. Additionally, SVs were confirmed in telomere reverse transcriptase (TERT) upstream regions in several cancers, associated with elevated TERT mRNA levels. We also highlight high-confidence gene fusions supported by both genomic and transcriptomic evidence, including a previously unde-scribed paired box 8 (PAX8)–nuclear factor, erythroid 2 like 2 (NFE2L2) fusion in thyroid carcinoma. In summary, we combine SV, CNA, and expression data to provide insights into the structural basis of CNAs as well as the impact of SVs on gene expression in tumors. cancer genomics | somatic structural variation | gene fusion | gene expression S omatic structural variants (SVs) in genomic DNA can lead to changes in gene copy number, which may contribute to tumor development by altering gene expression levels (1). Several studies have tried to systematically investigate the effect of copy number alterations (CNAs) on tumor transcriptomes (2, 3), but this can only explain part of the expression changes observed in tumors. Notably, there are several other mechanisms by which SVs can alter tumor transcriptional output, including creation of fusion genes. These may produce chimeric mRNAs encoding novel oncogenic proteins (4, 5) or, alternatively, fusion mRNAs that maintain their protein-coding sequence while being tran-scriptionally induced or repressed due to swapping of 5′ ends, including the promoter (6). Additionally, SVs can affect mRNA levels by bringing distant regulatory elements into the proximity of transcription start sites (TSSs) without structurally altering the mRNA (7). More systematic investigations of the impact of SVs on gene expression levels in tumors are, however, lacking, in part due to the fact that mapping of SVs is considerably more chal-lenging compared with determining CNA profiles. Additionally, although CNAs arise as a result of SVs, the two have generally been studied in isolation and the general structural basis of so-matic CNAs in tumors is poorly investigated. Recent studies have started to use whole-genome sequencing (WGS) to identify SVs in tumors, and multiple tools have been published (8–12). These are based on the idea that breakpoints should reveal themselves on the basis of discordant read pairs (13) or split reads mapping partially to both ends of fused chromosomal segments (14). Several factors complicate the analysis, in particular mappability issues due to repetitive sequence regions (15). Indeed, it has become clear that the results produced by different methods are not consistent, and some studies have intersected multiple ap-proaches to provide a presumed high-confidence set of predictions (16, 17). Adding to the challenges is the difficulty of assessing performance: True positive sets have thus far been obtained through simulated genomic sequences (18), but this will not re-flect the true complexity of cancer genomes. Improved bench-marking is thus desirable before SVs can be comprehensively studied with WGS in human cancers. Here, enabled by the availability of a large cancer cohort sub-jected to WGS by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) consor-tium, we map somatic SVs in 600 tumors across 18 different cancer types and determine relationships between SVs, CNAs, and mRNA expression. We compare SV breakpoints with those from microarray-based CNA data to evaluate and optimize tools and parameters for SV detection, which additionally gives insights into the structural basis of CNAs. We next investigate relation-ships between SVs and changes in gene expression levels, both in the context of gene fusions as well as SVs affecting putative reg-ulatory regions near TSSs. Finally, we combine breakpoints de-termined from WGS and RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) data to detect high-confidence fusion genes across this large cohort.},

The primary end point was progression-free survival based on blinded, independent radiographic assessment of postcontrast T1-weighted and noncontrast T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain scans.Results The primary end point of progression-free survival (PFS) was not significantly different for either cediranib alone (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.05; 95{\%} CI, 0.74 to 1.50; two-sided P = .90) or cediranib in combination with lomustine (HR = 0.76; 95{\%} CI, 0.53 to 1.08; two-sided P = .16) versus lomustine based on independent or local review of postcontrast T1-weighted MRI.Conclusion This study did not meet its primary end point of PFS prolongation with cediranib either as monotherapy or in combination with lomustine versus lomustine in patients with recurrent glioblastoma, although cediranib showed evidence of clinical activity on some secondary end points including time to deterioration in neurologic status and corticosteroid-sparing effects. },

However, specific mutational signatures associated with base excision repair (BER) defects remain to be characterized. Here, by analysing a series of colorectal cancers (CRC) using exome sequencing, we identified a particular spectrum of somatic mutations characterized by an enrichment of C {\textgreater} A transversions in NpCpA or NpCpT contexts, in three tumours from a MUTYH-associated polyposis (MAP) patient and in two cases harbouring pathogenic germline MUTYH mutations. In two series of adrenocortical carcinomas (ACC), we identified four tumours with a similar signature also presenting germline MUTYH mutations. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that MUTYH inactivation results in a particular mutational signature, which may serve as a useful marker of BER-related genomic instability in new cancer types.

Genetic testing and rational clinical management recommendations currently exist for the management of individuals with a variety of colorectal cancer syndromes, including hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC, also known as Lynch syndrome), familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), MYH-associated polyposis (MAP), and the hamartomatous polyposis syndromes (Peutz–Jeghers, juvenile polyposis, and Cowden disease). In addition to colorectal neoplasia, these syndromes frequently predispose carriers to a variety of extracolonic cancers. The elucidation of the genetic basis of several colorectal cancer predisposition syndromes over the past two decades has allowed for better management of individuals who are either affected with, or at-risk for inherited colorectal cancer syndromes. Appropriate multidisciplinary management of these individuals includes genetic counseling, genetic testing, clinical screening, and treatment recommendations. },

abstract = {Cell-to-cell variation is a universal feature of life that affects a wide range of biological phenomena, from developmental plasticity to tumour heterogeneity. Although recent advances have improved our ability to document cellular phenotypic variation, the fundamental mechanisms that generate variability from identical DNA sequences remain elusive. Here we reveal the landscape and principles of mammalian DNA regulatory variation by developing a robust method for mapping the accessible genome of individual cells by assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) integrated into a programmable microfluidics platform. Single-cell ATAC-seq (scATAC-seq) maps from hundreds of single cells in aggregate closely resemble accessibility profiles from tens of millions of cells and provide insights into cell-to-cell variation. Accessibility variance is systematically associated with specific trans-factors and cis-elements, and we discover combinations of trans-factors associated with either induction or suppression of cell-to-cell variability. We further identify sets of trans-factors associated with cell-type-specific accessibility variance across eight cell types. Targeted perturbations of cell cycle or transcription factor signalling evoke stimulus-specific changes in this observed variability. The pattern of accessibility variation in cis across the genome recapitulates chromosome compartments de novo, linking single-cell accessibility variation to three-dimensional genome organization. Single-cell analysis of DNA accessibility provides new insight into cellular variation of the 'regulome'. },

abstract = {MOTIVATION: In cancer genomics research, one important problem is that the solid tissue sample obtained from clinical settings is always a mixture of cancer and normal cells. The sample mixture brings complication in data analysis and results in biased findings if not correctly accounted for. Estimating tumor purity is of great interest, and a number of methods have been developed using gene expression, copy number variation or point mutation data.
RESULTS: We discover that in cancer samples, the distributions of data from Illumina Infinium 450 k methylation microarray are highly correlated with tumor purities. We develop a simple but effective method to estimate purities from the microarray data. Analyses of the Cancer Genome Atlas lung cancer data demonstrate favorable performance of the proposed method.
AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The method is implemented in InfiniumPurify, which is freely available at https://bitbucket.org/zhengxiaoqi/infiniumpurify.

abstract = {PURPOSE Although a high rate of spontaneous regression is observed in infants with stage D(S) neuroblastoma (NB), survival is not uniform. To determine the prognostic relevance of age at diagnosis, therapy, and tumor biology in infants with stage D(S) NB, we reviewed the Pediatric Oncology Group (POG) experience.PATIENTS AND METHODS A review of patients diagnosed with stage D(S) NB registered on POG protocols was performed. Survival according to age at diagnosis, treatment, and tumor biology was determined.RESULTS Between 1987 and 1996, 110 infants with stage D(S) NB had an estimated 3-year survival rate of 85{\%} +/- 4{\%}; survival rate was 71{\%} +/- 8{\%} for infants 2 months of age or younger, and 68{\%} +/- 12{\%}, 44{\%} +/- 33{\%}, and 33{\%} +/- 19{\%} for patients with diploid, MYCN-amplified, and unfavorable histology tumors, respectively. Survival rates were similar for patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy versus those who did not (82{\%} +/- 5{\%} v 93{\%} +/- 6{\%}, respectively; P = .187). Furthermore, there was no statistical difference in survival rate for patients who underwent complete resection of their primary tumor compared with those who underwent partial resection or biopsy only (90{\%} +/- 5{\%} v 78{\%} +/- 7{\%}, respectively; P = .083).CONCLUSION Our review confirmed that the survival of infants with stage D(S) NB is excellent. However, subsets of patients with poor prognosis can be identified by young age and unfavorable biologic factors. More effective therapy is needed for the group of stage D(S) infants who show unfavorable clinical and biologic features. },

abstract = {Mutations are the basis for evolution and the development of genetic diseases. Especially in cancer, somatic mutations in oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes alongside the occurrence of passenger mutations have been observed by recent deep-sequencing approaches. While mutations have long been considered random events induced by DNA-replication errors or by DNA damaging agents, genome sequencing led to the discovery of non-random mutation signatures in many human cancer. Common non-random mutations comprise DNA strand-biased mutation showers and mutations restricted to certain DNA motifs, which recently have become attributed to the activity of the AID/APOBEC family of DNA deaminases. Hence, APOBEC enzymes, which have evolved as key players in natural and adaptive immunity, have been proposed to contribute to cancer development and clonal evolution of cancer by inducing collateral genomic damage due to their DNA deaminating activity. This review focuses on how mutagenic events through AID/APOBEC deaminases may contribute to cancer development.},

Here we describe a computational platform that integrates the analysis of copy number variations and somatic mutations and unravels the landscape of in-frame gene fusions in glioblastoma. We found mutations with loss of heterozygosity in LZTR1, encoding an adaptor of CUL3-containing E3 ligase complexes. Mutations and deletions disrupt LZTR1 function, which restrains the self renewal and growth of glioma spheres that retain stem cell features. Loss-of-function mutations in CTNND2 target a neural-specific gene and are associated with the transformation of glioma cells along the very aggressive mesenchymal phenotype. We also report recurrent translocations that fuse the coding sequence of EGFR to several partners, with EGFR-SEPT14 being the most frequent functional gene fusion in human glioblastoma. EGFR-SEPT14 fusions activate STAT3 signaling and confer mitogen independence and sensitivity to EGFR inhibition. These results provide insights into the pathogenesis of glioblastoma and highlight new targets for therapeutic intervention. },

abstract = {Genomic instability and high mutation rates cause cancer to acquire numerous mutations and chromosomal alterations during its somatic evolution, most are termed passengers because they do not confer cancer phenotypes. Evolutionary simulations and cancer genomic studies suggest that mildly deleterious passengers accumulate and can collectively slow cancer progression. Clinical data also suggest an association between passenger load and response to therapeutics, yet no causal link between the effects of passengers and cancer progression has been established. To assess this, we introduced increasing passenger loads into human cell lines and immunocompromised mouse models. We found that passengers dramatically reduced proliferative fitness ({\~{}}3{\%} per Mb), slowed tumor growth, and reduced metastatic progression. We developed new genomic measures of damaging passenger load that can accurately predicted the fitness costs of passengers in cell lines and in human breast cancers. We conclude that genomic instability and elevated load of DNA alterations in cancer is a double-edged sword: it accelerates the accumulation of adaptive drivers, but incurs a harmful passenger load that can outweigh driver benefit. The effects of passenger alterations on cancer fitness were unrelated to enhanced immunity, as our tests were performed either in cell culture or in immunocompromised animals. Our findings refute traditional paradigms of passengers as neutral events, suggesting that passenger load reduces the fitness of cancer cells and slows or prevents progression of both primary and metastatic disease.

This malignancy represents a heterogeneous group of tumours with characteristic molecular features, prognosis and responses to available therapy. Recurrent somatic alterations in breast cancer have been described, including mutations and copy number alterations, notably ERBB2 amplifications, the first successful therapy target defined by a genomic aberration. Previous DNA sequencing studies of breast cancer genomes have revealed additional candidate mutations and gene rearrangements. Here we report the whole-exome sequences of DNA from 103 human breast cancers of diverse subtypes from patients in Mexico and Vietnam compared to matched-normal DNA, together with whole-genome sequences of 22 breast cancer/normal pairs. Beyond confirming recurrent somatic mutations in PIK3CA, TP53, AKT1, GATA3 and MAP3K1, we discovered recurrent mutations in the CBFB transcription factor gene and deletions of its partner RUNX1. Furthermore, we have identified a recurrent MAGI3-AKT3 fusion enriched in triple-negative breast cancer lacking oestrogen and progesterone receptors and ERBB2 expression. The MAGI3-AKT3 fusion leads to constitutive activation of AKT kinase, which is abolished by treatment with an ATP-competitive AKT small-molecule inhibitor.},

abstract = {Despite the potential of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) to improve patient diagnosis and care, the empirical value of WGS in the cancer genetics clinic is unknown. We performed WGS on members of two cohorts of cancer genetics patients: those with BRCA1/2 mutations (n = 176) and those without (n = 82). Initial analysis of potentially pathogenic variants (PPVs, defined as nonsynonymous variants with allele frequency {\textless} 1{\%} in ESP6500) in 163 clinically-relevant genes suggested that WGS will provide useful clinical results. This is despite the fact that a majority of PPVs were novel missense variants likely to be classified as variants of unknown significance (VUS). Furthermore, previously reported pathogenic missense variants did not always associate with their predicted diseases in our patients. This suggests that the clinical use of WGS will require large-scale efforts to consolidate WGS and patient data to improve accuracy of interpretation of rare variants. While loss-of-function (LoF) variants represented only a small fraction of PPVs, WGS identified additional cancer risk LoF PPVs in patients with known BRCA1/2 mutations and led to cancer risk diagnoses in 21{\%} of non-BRCA cancer genetics patients after expanding our analysis to 3209 ClinVar genes. These data illustrate how WGS can be used to improve our ability to discover patients' cancer genetic risks.},

abstract = {brief communications 396 | VOL.11 NO.4 | APRIL 2014 | nature methods each harbors at most one somatic mutant genotype) and persist-ent (mutations do not disappear or revert) phylogeny, we can identify and quantify the prevalence of clonal populations. These assumptions imply that clusters of mutations occurring at the same point in the clonal phylogeny are present at shared cellular prevalences. Thus, clusters of mutations can be used as markers of clonal populations. (Limitations for when these assumptions do not hold are presented in the Supplementary Discussion.) Despite progress in measuring allele prevalence with deep sequencing 4–8 , statistical approaches to cluster deep digital sequencing of mutations into biologically relevant groupings remain underdeveloped, with poorly understood analytical assumptions. The allelic prevalence of a mutation is a compound measure of several factors: the proportion of 'contaminating' normal cells, the proportion of tumor cells harboring the mutation and the number of allelic copies of the mutation in each cell, plus uncharacterized sources of technical noise. Consequently, allelic prevalence does not straightforwardly relate to cellular preva-lence. This is particularly exacerbated when only single sample allelic prevalence estimates are taken. Multiple sample measure-ments (taken across time 5,9 or space 10) have two distinct advan-tages: reduction of noise owing to repeated measures and the potential to identify sets of mutations whose cellular prevalences shift together. The latter is a route to precisely identifying clones whose prevalences are changing under selective pressures. PyClone systematically addresses these deficiencies (Supplementary Figs. 2 and 3). The inputs to the model are a set of deeply sequenced mutations from one or more samples derived from a single patient and a measure of allele-specific copy number at each mutation locus in each sample (Supplementary Fig. 4). Allele-specific copy number can be obtained from high-density genotyping arrays or from whole-genome sequencing data (Online Methods). PyClone outputs posterior densities for model param-eters such as the cellular prevalence for each mutation in the input (Supplementary Fig. 5) and the clustering structure over the mutations (Supplementary Figs. 6–11). The posterior densities of these quantities are then postprocessed to give interpretable point estimates of the cellular prevalences and mutational clustering. The PyClone framework (full mathematical and implemen-tation details are in the Supplementary Note) overcomes the challenges outlined earlier through four novel modeling advances. First, it uses beta-binomial emission densities, which models data sets with more variance in allelic prevalence measurements more effectively than a binomial model. Second, flexible prior probability estimates ('priors') of possible mutational genotypes are used, reflecting how allelic prevalence measurements are deterministically linked to zygosity and coincident copy-number We introduce Pyclone, a statistical model for inference of clonal population structures in cancers. Pyclone is a bayesian clustering method for grouping sets of deeply sequenced somatic mutations into putative clonal clusters while estimating their cellular prevalences and accounting for allelic imbalances introduced by segmental copy-number changes and normal-cell contamination. single-cell sequencing validation demonstrates Pyclone's accuracy. Human cancer progresses under Darwinian evolution, in which genetic or epigenetic variation alters molecular phenotypes in individual cells 1 . Consequently, tumors at diagnosis often consist of multiple, genotypically distinct cell populations 2 (Supplementary Fig. 1). These populations, referred to as clones, are related through a phylogeny and act as substrates for selection in tumor microenvironments or with therapeutic intervention 2,3 . The prevalence of a particular clone measured over time or in anatomic space is a reflection of its growth and proliferative fitness. Thus, ascertaining the dynamic prevalence of clones can help identify precise genetic determinants of phenotypes such as acqui-sition of metastatic potential or chemotherapeutic resistance. We provide a hierarchical Bayes statistical model, PyClone (Supplementary Figs. 2 and 3), for analysis of deeply sequenced (coverage {\textgreater} 100×) mutations to identify and quantify clonal popu-lations in tumors, which extends to modeling mutations measured in multiple samples from the same patient. Our approach uses the measurement of allelic prevalence to estimate the proportion of tumor cells harboring a mutation (referred to herein as the 'cellular prevalence'). Owing to the cell lysis involved in the prepa-ration of bulk samples for sequencing, we cannot determine the complete set of genomic aberrations defining a clonal population. However, assuming that clonal populations follow a perfect (that is, no site mutates more than once in its evolutionary history, and},

abstract = {Targeting defects in the DNA repair machinery of neoplastic cells, for example, those due to inactivating BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 mutations, has been used for developing new therapies in certain types of breast, ovarian and pancreatic cancers. Recently, a mutational signature was associated with failure of double-strand DNA break repair by homologous recombination based on its high mutational burden in samples harbouring BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations. In pancreatic cancer, all responders to platinum therapy exhibit this mutational signature including a sample that lacked any defects in BRCA1 or BRCA2. Here, we examine 10,250 cancer genomes across 36 types of cancer and demonstrate that, in addition to breast, ovarian and pancreatic cancers, gastric cancer is another cancer type that exhibits this mutational signature. Our results suggest that 7-12{\%} of gastric cancers have defective double-strand DNA break repair by homologous recombination and may benefit from either platinum therapy or PARP inhibitors.},

abstract = {Background PAM50 is a 50-gene test that is designed to identify intrinsic breast cancer subtypes and generate a Risk of Recurrence (ROR) score. It has been developed to be carried out in qualified routine hospital pathology laboratories.Patients and Methods One thousand four hundred seventy-eight postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor (ER)+ early breast cancer (EBC) treated with tamoxifen or tamoxifen followed by anastrozole from the prospective randomized ABCSG-8 trial were entered into this study. Patients did not receive adjuvant chemotherapy. RNA was extracted from paraffin blocks and analyzed using the PAM50 test. Both intrinsic subtype (luminal A/B, HER2-enriched, basal-like) and ROR score were calculated. The primary analysis was designed to test whether the continuous ROR score adds prognostic value in predicting distant recurrence (DR) over and above standard clinical variables.Results In all tested subgroups, ROR score significantly adds prognostic information to the clinical predictor (P {\textless} 0.0001). PAM50 assigns an intrinsic subtype to all cases, and the luminal A cohort had a significantly lower ROR at 10 years compared with Luminal B (P {\textless} 0.0001). Significant and clinically relevant discrimination between low- and high-risk groups occurred also within all tested subgroups.Conclusion(s) The results of the primary analysis, in combination with recently published results from the ATAC trial, constitute Level 1 evidence for clinical validity of the PAM50 test for predicting the risk of DR in postmenopausal women with ER+ EBC. A 10-year metastasis risk of {\textless}3.5{\%} in the ROR low category makes it unlikely that additional chemotherapy would improve this outcome—this finding could help to avoid unwarranted overtreatment.Clinical trial number ABCSG 8: NCT00291759. },

abstract = {Background: Inherited mutations in the BRCA1 gene may be responsible for almost half of inherited breast carcinomas. However, somatic (acquired) mutations in BRCA1 have not been reported, despite frequent loss of heterozygosity (LOH or loss of one copy of the gene) at the BRCA1 locus and loss of BRCA1 protein in tumors. To address whether BRCA1 may be inactivated by pathways other than mutations in sporadic tumors, we analyzed the role of hypermethylation of the gene's promoter region. Methods: Methylation patterns in the BRCA1 promoter were assessed in breast cancer cell lines, xenografts, and 215 primary breast and ovarian carcinomas by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR). BRCA1 RNA expression was determined in cell lines and seven xenografts by reverse transcription–PCR. P values are two-sided. Results: The BRCA1 promoter was found to be unmethylated in all normal tissues and cancer cell lines tested. However, BRCA1 promoter hypermethylation was present in two breast cancer xenografts, both of which had loss of the BRCA1 transcript. BRCA1 promoter hypermethylation was present in 11 (13{\%}) of 84 unselected primary breast carcinomas. BRCA1 methylation was strikingly associated with the medullary (67{\%} methylated; P = .0002 versus ductal) and mucinous (55{\%} methylated; P = .0033 versus ductal) subtypes, which are overrepresented in BRCA1 families. In a second series of 66 ductal breast tumors informative for LOH, nine (20{\%}) of 45 tumors with LOH had BRCA1 hypermethylation, while one (5{\%}) of 21 without LOH was methylated (P = .15). In ovarian neoplasms, BRCA1 methylation was found only in tumors with LOH, four (31{\%}) of 13 versus none of 18 without LOH (P = .02). The BRCA1 promoter was unmethylated in other tumor types. Conclusion: Silencing of the BRCA1 gene by promoter hypermethylation occurs in primary breast and ovarian carcinomas, especially in the presence of LOH and in specific histopathologic subgroups. These findings support a role for this tumor suppressor gene in sporadic breast and ovarian tumorigenesis.  },

abstract = {The assembly of DNA sequences de novo is fundamental to genomics research. It is the first of many steps toward elucidating and characterizing whole genomes. Downstream applications, including analysis of genomic variation between species, between or within individuals critically depend on robustly assembled sequences. In the span of a single decade, the sequence throughput of leading DNA sequencing instruments has increased drastically, and coupled with established and planned large-scale, personalized medicine initiatives to sequence genomes in the thousands and even millions, the development of efficient, scalable and accurate bioinformatics tools for producing high-quality reference draft genomes is timely. With ABySS 1.0, we originally showed that assembling the human genome using short 50-bp sequencing reads was possible by aggregating the half terabyte of compute memory needed over several computers using a standardized message-passing system (MPI). We present here its redesign, which departs from MPI and instead implements algorithms that employ a Bloom filter, a probabilistic data structure, to represent a de Bruijn graph and reduce memory requirements. We benchmarked ABySS 2.0 human genome assembly using a Genome in a Bottle data set of 250-bp Illumina paired-end and 6-kbp mate-pair libraries from a single individual. Our assembly yielded a NG50 (NGA50) scaffold contiguity of 3.5 (3.0) Mbp using {\textless}35 GB of RAM. This is a modest memory requirement by today's standards and is often available on a single computer. We also investigate the use of BioNano Genomics and 10x Genomics' Chromium data to further improve the scaffold NG50 (NGA50) of this assembly to 42 (15) Mbp.},

In the current study, we devised a pipeline to predict novel alternative splicing (AS) variants from high-throughput transcriptome sequencing data and applied it to large sets of tumor transcriptomes from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We identified two novel tumor-associated splice variants of matriptase, a known cancer-associated gene, in the transcriptome data from epithelial-derived tumors but not normal tissue. Most notably, these variants were found in 69{\%} of lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) samples studied. We confirmed the expression of matriptase AS transcripts using quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) in an orthogonal panel of tumor tissues and cell lines. Furthermore, flow cytometric analysis confirmed surface expression of matriptase splice variants in chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells transiently transfected with cDNA encoding the novel transcripts. Our findings further implicate matriptase in contributing to oncogenic processes and suggest potential novel therapeutic uses for matriptase splice variants.},

abstract = {Purpose The International Neuroblastoma Risk Group (INRG) classification system was developed to establish a consensus approach for pretreatment risk stratification. Because the International Neuroblastoma Staging System (INSS) is a postsurgical staging system, a new clinical staging system was required for the INRG pretreatment risk classification system.Methods To stage patients before any treatment, the INRG Task Force, consisting of neuroblastoma experts from Australia/New Zealand, China, Europe, Japan, and North America, developed a new INRG staging system (INRGSS) based on clinical criteria and image-defined risk factors (IDRFs). To investigate the impact of IDRFs on outcome, survival analyses were performed on 661 European patients with INSS stages 1, 2, or 3 disease for whom IDRFs were known.Results In the INGRSS, locoregional tumors are staged L1 or L2 based on the absence or presence of one or more of 20 IDRFs, respectively. Metastatic tumors are defined as stage M, except for stage MS, in which metastases are confined to the skin, liver, and/or bone marrow in children younger than 18 months of age. Within the 661-patient cohort, IDRFs were present (ie, stage L2) in 21{\%} of patients with stage 1, 45{\%} of patients with stage 2, and 94{\%} of patients with stage 3 disease. Patients with INRGSS stage L2 disease had significantly lower 5-year event-free survival than those with INRGSS stage L1 disease (78{\%} ± 4{\%} v 90{\%} ± 3{\%}; P = .0010).Conclusion Use of the new staging (INRGSS) and risk classification (INRG) of neuroblastoma will greatly facilitate the comparison of risk-based clinical trials conducted in different regions of the world. },

With the availability of fast and inexpensive computing, their main limitation would be some lack of flexibility to work with arbitrary experimental designs. In this paper we report on results on approximate permutation methods that are more flexible with respect to the experimental design and nuisance variables, and conduct detailed simulations to identify the best method for settings that are typical for imaging research scenarios. We present a generic framework for permutation inference for complex general linear models (glms) when the errors are exchangeable and/or have a symmetric distribution, and show that, even in the presence of nuisance effects, these permutation inferences are powerful while providing excellent control of false positives in a wide range of common and relevant imaging research scenarios. We also demonstrate how the inference on glm parameters, originally intended for independent data, can be used in certain special but useful cases in which independence is violated. Detailed examples of common neuroimaging applications are provided, as well as a complete algorithm – the “randomise” algorithm – for permutation inference with the glm.},

A multitude of CARs has been reported over the past decade, targeting an array of cell surface tumor antigens. Their biologic functions have dramatically changed following the introduction of tripartite receptors comprising a costimulatory domain, termed second-generation CARs. These have recently shown clinical benefit in patients treated with CD19-targeted autologous T cells. CARs may be combined with costimulatory ligands, chimeric costimulatory receptors, or cytokines to further enhance T-cell potency, specificity, and safety. CARs represent a new class of drugs with exciting potential for cancer immunotherapy.Significance: CARs are a new class of drugs with great potential for cancer immunotherapy. Upon their expression in T lymphocytes, CARs direct potent, targeted immune responses that have recently shown encouraging clinical outcomes in a subset of patients with B-cell malignancies. This review focuses on the design of CARs, including the requirements for optimal antigen recognition and different modalities to provide costimulatory support to targeted T cells, which include the use of second- and third-generation CARs, costimulatory ligands, chimeric costimulatory receptors, and cytokines.

abstract = {Osteosarcoma is the most common primary bone tumor, yet there have been no substantial advances in treatment or survival in three decades. We examined 59 tumor/normal pairs by whole-exome, whole-genome, and RNA-sequencing. Only the TP53 gene was mutated at significant frequency across all samples. The mean nonsilent somatic mutation rate was 1.2 mutations per megabase, and there was a median of 230 somatic rearrangements per tumor. Complex chains of rearrangements and localized hypermutation were detected in almost all cases. Given the intertumor heterogeneity, the extent of genomic instability, and the difficulty in acquiring a large sample size in a rare tumor, we used several methods to identify genomic events contributing to osteosarcoma survival. Pathway analysis, a heuristic analytic algorithm, a comparative oncology approach, and an shRNA screen converged on the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/mammalian target of rapamycin (PI3K/mTOR) pathway as a central vulnerability for therapeutic exploitation in osteosarcoma. Osteosarcoma cell lines are responsive to pharmacologic and genetic inhibition of the PI3K/mTOR pathway both in vitro and in vivo. },

abstract = {Microsatellite instability (MSI) is a form of hypermutation that occurs in some tumors due to defects in cellular DNA mismatch repair. MSI is characterized by frequent somatic mutations (i.e., cancer-specific mutations) that change the length of simple repeats (e.g., AAAAA{\ldots}., GATAGATAGATA...). Clinical MSI tests evaluate the lengths of a handful of simple repeat sites, while next-generation sequencing can assay many more sites and offers a much more complete view of their somatic mutation frequencies. Using somatic mutation data from the exomes of a 361-tumor training set, we developed classifiers to determine MSI status based on four machine-learning frameworks. All frameworks had high accuracy, and after choosing one we determined that it had {\textgreater}98{\%} concordance with clinical tests in a separate 163-tumor test set. Furthermore, this classifier retained high concordance even when classifying tumors based on subsets of whole-exome data. We have released a CRAN R package, MSIseq, based on this classifier. MSIseq is faster and simpler to use than software that requires large files of aligned sequenced reads. MSIseq will be useful for genomic studies in which clinical MSI test results are unavailable and for detecting possible misclassifications by clinical tests. },

We demonstrate that mutation patterns in immortalised cell lines derived from primary murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) exposed in vitro to carcinogens recapitulate key features of mutational signatures observed in human cancers. In experiments with several cancer-causing agents we obtained high genome-wide concordance between human tumour mutation data and in vitro data with respect to predominant substitution types, strand bias and sequence context. Moreover, we found signature mutations in well-studied human cancer driver genes. To explore endogenous mutagenesis, we used MEFs ectopically expressing activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) and observed an excess of AID signature mutations in immortalised cell lines compared to their non-transgenic counterparts. MEF immortalisation is thus a simple and powerful strategy for modelling cancer mutation landscapes that facilitates the interpretation of human tumour genome-wide sequencing data.},

abstract = {Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer worldwide, with 1.2 million patients diagnosed annually. In late-stage colorectal cancer, the most commonly used targeted therapies are the monoclonal antibodies cetuximab and panitumumab, which prevent epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activation. Recent studies have identified alterations in KRAS and other genes as likely mechanisms of primary and secondary resistance to anti-EGFR antibody therapy. Despite these efforts, additional mechanisms of resistance to EGFR blockade are thought to be present in colorectal cancer and little is known about determinants of sensitivity to this therapy. To examine the effect of somatic genetic changes in colorectal cancer on response to anti-EGFR antibody therapy, here we perform complete exome sequence and copy number analyses of 129 patient-derived tumour grafts and targeted genomic analyses of 55 patient tumours, all of which were KRAS wild-type. We analysed the response of tumours to anti-EGFR antibody blockade in tumour graft models and in clinical settings and functionally linked therapeutic responses to mutational data. In addition to previously identified genes, we detected mutations in ERBB2, EGFR, FGFR1, PDGFRA, and MAP2K1 as potential mechanisms of primary resistance to this therapy. Novel alterations in the ectodomain of EGFR were identified in patients with acquired resistance to EGFR blockade. Amplifications and sequence changes in the tyrosine kinase receptor adaptor gene IRS2 were identified in tumours with increased sensitivity to anti-EGFR therapy. Therapeutic resistance to EGFR blockade could be overcome in tumour graft models through combinatorial therapies targeting actionable genes. These analyses provide a systematic approach to evaluating response to targeted therapies in human cancer, highlight new mechanisms of responsiveness to anti-EGFR therapies, and delineate new avenues for intervention in managing colorectal cancer. },

abstract = {Background 
Gastrointestinal symptoms are reportedly common in diabetes, but a causal link is controversial and adequate population control data are lacking.Objective
To determine whether gastrointestinal symptoms are more frequent in persons with diabetes, particularly in those with poor glycemic control.Methods
Fifteen thousand adults were mailed a questionnaire (response rate, 60.0{\%}) containing validated questions on the frequency of troublesome gastrointestinal symptoms within the past 3 months, diabetic status, and self-reported glycemic control. The prevalence of 16 symptoms and 5 symptom complexes, reported to occur often or very often, was compared using logistic regression analysis, adjusting for age and sex.Results
Overall, 8657 eligible subjects responded; 423 (4.9{\%}) reported having diabetes. Most (94.8{\%}) had type 2 diabetes mellitus. Adjusting for age and sex, all 16 symptoms and the 5 symptom complexes were significantly more frequent in subjects with diabetes compared with controls. An increased prevalence rate of symptoms was significantly associated with poorer levels of glycemic control but not with duration of diabetes or type of diabetic treatment.Conclusions
Diabetes mellitus is associated with an increased prevalence of upper and lower gastrointestinal symptoms. This effect may be linked to poor glycemic control but not to duration of diabetes or type of treatment.},

abstract = {The somatic mutations in a cancer genome are the aggregate outcome of one or more mutational processes operative through the lifetime of the individual with cancer. Each mutational process leaves a characteristic mutational signature determined by the mechanisms of DNA damage and repair that constitute it. A role was recently proposed for the APOBEC family of cytidine deaminases in generating particular genome-wide mutational signatures and a signature of localized hypermutation called kataegis. A germline copy number polymorphism involving APOBEC3A and APOBEC3B, which effectively deletes APOBEC3B, has been associated with modestly increased risk of breast cancer. Here we show that breast cancers in carriers of the deletion show more mutations of the putative APOBEC-dependent genome-wide signatures than cancers in non-carriers. The results suggest that the APOBEC3A-APOBEC3B germline deletion allele confers cancer susceptibility through increased activity of APOBEC-dependent mutational processes, although the mechanism by which this increase in activity occurs remains unknown.},

Eight of nine exons and nine of sixteen intronic flanking sequences were scanned, encompassing {\textgreater}900 bp of the HPRT gene. Mutant hotspots were detected and separated by differences in their melting temperatures using constant denaturant capillary electrophoresis (CDCE) or denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE).A key finding of this work is that a high proportion of all HPRT inactivating mutations is represented by a small number of hotspots distributed over the exons and mRNA splice sites. Thirteen spontaneous hotspots and sixteen MNNG-induced hotspots accounted for 55{\%} and 48{\%} of all 6TG(R) point mutations, respectively. MNNG-induced hotspots were predominantly G:C--{\textgreater}A:T transitions. The spontaneous spectrum of cells deficient in hMSH6 contained transversions (A:T--{\textgreater}T:A, G:C--{\textgreater}T:A, A:T--{\textgreater}C:G), transitions (A:T--{\textgreater}G:C), a plus-one insertion, and a minus-one deletion.

abstract = {An ever-expanding understanding of the molecular basis of the more than 200 unique diseases collectively called cancer, combined with efforts to apply these insights to clinical care, is forming the foundation of an era of personalized medicine that promises to improve cancer treatment. At the same time, these extraordinary opportunities are occurring in an environment of intense pressure to contain rising healthcare costs. This environment presents a challenge to oncology research and clinical care, because both are becoming progressively more complex and expensive, and because the current tools to measure the cost and value of advances in care (e.g., comparative effectiveness research, cost-effectiveness analysis, and health technology assessments) are not optimized for an ecosystem moving toward personalized, patient-centered care. Reconciling this tension will be essential to maintaining progress in a cost-constrained environment, especially because emerging innovations in science (e.g., increasing identification of molecular biomarkers) and in clinical process (implementation of a learning healthcare system) hold potential to dramatically improve patient care, and may ultimately help address the burden of rising costs. For example, the rapid pace of innovation taking place within oncology calls for increased capability to integrate clinical research and care to enable continuous learning, so that lessons learned from each patient treated can inform clinical decision making for the next patient. Recognizing the need to define the policies required for sustained innovation in cancer research and care in an era of cost containment, the stakeholder community must engage in an ongoing dialogue and identify areas for collaboration. This article reflects and seeks to amplify the ongoing robust discussion and diverse perspectives brought to this issue by multiple stakeholders within the cancer community, and to consider how to frame the research and regulatory policies necessary to sustain progress against cancer in an environment of constrained resources.

We explored the mechanism of potentiation of temozolomide cytotoxicity by the PARP inhibitor ABT-888. We showed that cells treated with temozolomide need to be exposed to ABT-888 for at least 17 to 24 hours to achieve maximal cytotoxicity. The extent of cytotoxicity correlates with the level of double-stranded DNA breaks as indicated by $\gamma$H2AX levels. In synchronized cells, damaging DNA with temozolomide in the presence of ABT-888 during the S phase generated high levels of double-stranded breaks, presumably because the single-stranded DNA breaks resulting from the cleavage of the methylated nucleotides were converted into double-stranded breaks through DNA replication. As a result, treatment of temozolomide and ABT-888 during the S phase leads to higher levels of cytotoxicity. ABT-888 inhibits poly(ADP-ribose) formation in vivo and enhances tumor growth inhibition by temozolomide in multiple models. ABT-888 is well tolerated in animal models. ABT-888 is currently in clinical trials in combination with temozolomide. (Mol Cancer Res 2008;6(10):1621–9) },

The roles of miRNAs in lineage determination and proliferation as well as the location of several miRNA genes at sites of translocation breakpoints or deletions has led to the speculation that miRNAs could be important factors in the development or maintenance of the neoplastic state. Here we show that the highly malignant human brain tumor, glioblastoma, strongly overexpresses a specific miRNA, miR-21. Our studies show markedly elevated miR-21 levels in human glioblastoma tumor tissues, early-passage glioblastoma cultures, and in six established glioblastoma cell lines (A172, U87, U373, LN229, LN428, and LN308) compared with nonneoplastic fetal and adult brain tissues and compared with cultured nonneoplastic glial cells. Knockdown of miR-21 in cultured glioblastoma cells triggers activation of caspases and leads to increased apoptotic cell death. Our data suggest that aberrantly expressed miR-21 may contribute to the malignant phenotype by blocking expression of critical apoptosis-related genes. },

These processes mark the genome, such that a cancer's life history is encrypted in the somatic mutations present. We developed algorithms to decipher this narrative and applied them to 21 breast cancers. Mutational processes evolve across a cancer's lifespan, with many emerging late but contributing extensive genetic variation. Subclonal diversification is prominent, and most mutations are found in just a fraction of tumor cells. Every tumor has a dominant subclonal lineage, representing more than 50{\%} of tumor cells. Minimal expansion of these subclones occurs until many hundreds to thousands of mutations have accumulated, implying the existence of long-lived, quiescent cell lineages capable of substantial proliferation upon acquisition of enabling genomic changes. Expansion of the dominant subclone to an appreciable mass may therefore represent the final rate-limiting step in a breast cancer's development, triggering diagnosis.Copyright {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Although the instrument is considered very practical and moderately effective for use by clinicians who manage concussion, the utility and sensitivity of a 100-point scoring system for the SCAT2 has been questioned. The 2012 CISG Consensus Meeting provided an opportunity for several of the world's leading concussion researchers and clinicians to present data and to share experiences using the SCAT2. The purpose of this report is to consider recommendations by the CISG, and to review the current literature to identify the most sensitive and reliable concussion assessment components for inclusion in a revised version—the SCAT3. Through this process, it was determined that important clinical information can be ascertained in a streamlined manner through the use of a multimodal instrument such as the SCAT3. This test battery should include an initial assessment of injury severity using the Glasgow Coma Scale, immediately followed by observing and documenting concussion signs. Once this is complete, symptom endorsement and symptom severity, neurocognitive function and balance function should be assessed in any athlete suspected of sustaining a concussion. There is no evidence to support the use of a composite/total score; however, there is good evidence to support the use of each component (scored independently) in a revised assessment tool. },

abstract = {Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is one of the most common cancers worldwide and the fourth most lethal cancer in China. However, although genomic studies have identified some mutations associated with ESCC, we know little of the mutational processes responsible. To identify genome-wide mutational signatures, we performed either whole-genome sequencing (WGS) or whole-exome sequencing (WES) on 104 ESCC individuals and combined our data with those of 88 previously reported samples. An APOBEC-mediated mutational signature in 47{\%} of 192 tumors suggests that APOBEC-catalyzed deamination provides a source of DNA damage in ESCC. Moreover, PIK3CA hotspot mutations (c.1624G{\textgreater}A [p.Glu542Lys] and c.1633G{\textgreater}A [p.Glu545Lys]) were enriched in APOBEC-signature tumors, and no smoking-associated signature was observed in ESCC. In the samples analyzed by WGS, we identified focal ({\textless}100 kb) amplifications of CBX4 and CBX8. In our combined cohort, we identified frequent inactivating mutations in AJUBA, ZNF750, and PTCH1 and the chromatin-remodeling genes CREBBP and BAP1, in addition to known mutations. Functional analyses suggest roles for several genes (CBX4, CBX8, AJUBA, and ZNF750) in ESCC. Notably, high activity of hedgehog signaling and the PI3K pathway in approximately 60{\%} of 104 ESCC tumors indicates that therapies targeting these pathways might be particularly promising strategies for ESCC. Collectively, our data provide comprehensive insights into the mutational signatures of ESCC and identify markers for early diagnosis and potential therapeutic targets},

However, analyses of these data sets generally do not indicate the order in which mutations have occurred, or the resulting karyotype. Here, we introduce a mathematical framework that begins to address this problem. By using samples with accurate data sets, we can reconstruct relatively complex temporal sequences of rearrangements and provide an assembly of genomic segments into digital karyotypes.

abstract = {This study describes how the new massive parallel sequencing technology can be implemented in a diagnostic setting for the breast cancer susceptibility genes (BRCA1 and BRCA2). The throughput was maximized by increasing uniformity in coverage, obtained by a multiplex approach, which outperformed pooling of singleplex PCRs. We evaluated the sensitivity by analysis of 133 distinct sequence variants; three (2{\%}) deletions or duplications in homopolymers of greater than or equal to seven nucleotides remained undetected, illustrating a limitation of pyrosequencing. Furthermore, other limitations like nonrandom sequencing errors, pseudogene amplification, and failure to detect multiexon deletions are thoroughly described. Our workflow illustrates the potential of massive parallel sequencing of large genes in a diagnostic setting, which is of great importance to meet the increasing expectations of genetic testing. Implementation of this approach will hopefully lead to a strong reduction in turnaround times. As a consequence a wider spectrum of at risk women will be able to benefit from therapeutic interventions and prophylactic interventions.},

However, high inter-tumor heterogeneity is a major obstacle to developing and applying therapeutic targeted agents to treat most cancer patients. Here, we offer a comprehensive assessment of the scope of targeted therapeutic agents in a large pan-cancer cohort. We developed an in silico prescription strategy based on identification of the driver alterations in each tumor and their druggability options. Although relatively few tumors are tractable by approved agents following clinical guidelines (5.9{\%}), up to 40.2{\%} could benefit from different repurposing options, and up to 73.3{\%} considering treatments currently under clinical investigation. We also identified 80 therapeutically targetable cancer genes.},

Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technology has emerged as the primary means of interrogating the SVs of the cancer genome in recent investigations. Sophisticated computational methods are required to accurately identify the SV events and delineate their breakpoints from the massive amounts of reads generated by a NGS experiment. In this review, we provide an overview of current analytic tools used for SV detection in NGS-based cancer studies. We summarize the features of common SV groups and the primary types of NGS signatures that can be used in SV detection methods. We discuss the principles and key similarities and differences of existing computational programs and comment on unresolved issues related to this research field. The aim of this article is to provide a practical guide of relevant concepts, computational methods, software tools and important factors for analyzing and interpreting NGS data for the detection of SVs in the cancer genome.},

We demonstrate that current sequencing paradigms are inadequate for tumors that are impure, aneuploid, or clonally heterogeneous. To reassess optimal sequencing strategies, we performed ultra-deep (up to ∼312x) whole genome sequencing and exome capture (up to ∼433x) of a primary acute myeloid leukemia, its subsequent relapse, and a matched normal skin sample. We tested multiple alignment and variant calling algorithms and validated ∼200,000 putative SNVs by sequencing them to depths of ∼1,000x. Additional targeted sequencing provided over 10,000x coverage and ddPCR assays provided up to ∼250,000x sampling of selected sites. We evaluated the effects of different library generation approaches, depth of sequencing, and analysis strategies on the ability to effectively characterize a complex tumor. This dataset, representing the most comprehensively sequenced tumor described to date, will serve as an invaluable community resource (dbGaP: phs000159).},

abstract = {Recent improvements in next-generation sequencing of tumor samples and the ability to identify somatic mutations at low allelic fractions have opened the way for new approaches to model the evolution of individual cancers. The power and utility of these models is increased when tumor samples from multiple sites are sequenced. Temporal ordering of the samples may provide insight into the etiology of both primary and metastatic lesions and rationalizations for tumor recurrence and therapeutic failures. Additional insights may be provided by temporal ordering of evolving subclones-cellular subpopulations with unique mutational profiles. Current methods for subclone hierarchy inference tightly couple the problem of temporal ordering with that of estimating the fraction of cancer cells harboring each mutation. We present a new framework that includes a rigorous statistical hypothesis test and a collection of tools that make it possible to decouple these problems, which we believe will enable substantial progress in the field of subclone hierarchy inference. The methods presented here can be flexibly combined with methods developed by others addressing either of these problems. We provide tools to interpret hypothesis test results, which inform phylogenetic tree construction, and we introduce the first genetic algorithm designed for this purpose. The utility of our framework is systematically demonstrated in simulations. For most tested combinations of tumor purity, sequencing coverage, and tree complexity, good power (≥ 0.8) can be achieved and Type 1 error is well controlled when at least three tumor samples are available from a patient. Using data from three published multi-region tumor sequencing studies of (murine) small cell lung cancer, acute myeloid leukemia, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, in which the authors reconstructed subclonal phylogenetic trees by manual expert curation, we show how different configurations of our tools can identify either a single tree in agreement with the authors, or a small set of trees, which include the authors' preferred tree. Our results have implications for improved modeling of tumor evolution and the importance of multi-region tumor sequencing. },

Although PDL copy-number variations are well characterized, a detailed and comprehensive analysis of structural rearrangements (SRs) and associated phenotypic consequences is largely lacking. Here, we used oligonucleotide capture sequencing of 67 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues derived from primary B-cell lymphomas and 1 cell line to detect and characterize, at base-pair resolution, SRs of the PDL locus (9p24.1; harboring PDL1/CD274 and PDL2/PDCD1LG2). We describe 36 novel PDL SRs, including 17 intrachromosomal events (inversions, duplications, deletions) and 19 translocations involving BZRAP-AS1, CD44, GET4, IL4R, KIAA0226L, MID1, RCC1, PTPN1 and segments of the immunoglobulin loci. Moreover, analysis of the precise chromosomal breakpoints reveals 2 distinct cluster breakpoint regions (CBRs) within either CD274 (CBR1) or PDCD1LG2 (CBR2). To determine the phenotypic consequences of these SRs, we performed immunohistochemistry for CD274 and PDCD1LG2 on primary pretreatment biopsies and found that PDL SRs are significantly associated with PDL protein expression. Finally, stable ectopic expression of wild-type PDCD1LG2 and the PDCD1LG2-IGHV7-81 fusion showed, in coculture, significantly reduced T-cell activation. Taken together, our data demonstrate the complementary utility of fluorescence in situ hybridization and capture sequencing approaches and provide a classification scheme for PDL SRs with implications for future studies using PDL immune-checkpoint inhibitors in B-cell lymphomas.},

The association between use of aspirin and other NSAIDs and risk of adult glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) was evaluated among 236 incident GBM cases and 401 population-based controls frequency-matched on age, gender, and ethnicity from the San Francisco Bay Area Adult Glioma Study. Cases (or proxies) and controls were interviewed in person between May 1997 and August 2000. Cases with self-reported GBM reported less use of at least 600 pills of all types of NSAIDs combined during the 10-year prediagnostic period than did controls (odds ratio (OR) = 0.53, 95{\%} confidence interval (CI): 0.3, 0.8). Findings were consistent for aspirin (OR = 0.51, 95{\%} CI: 0.3, 0.8), ibuprofen (OR = 0.41, 95{\%} CI: 0.2, 0.8), and naproxen/other NSAIDs (OR = 0.34, 95{\%} CI: 0.1, 0.8). GBM cases also reported less use of acetaminophen than did controls (OR = 0.51, 95{\%} CI: 0.3, 1.0). Eliminating participants who initiated NSAID use within 2 years of diagnosis yielded similar results. These findings show an inverse association between NSAID use and GBM. Further studies are warranted to determine whether NSAIDs might be effective in the inhibition of GBM development or progression. },

abstract = {The cancer genome is moulded by the dual processes of somatic mutation and selection. Homozygous deletions in cancer genomes occur over recessive cancer genes, where they can confer selective growth advantage, and over fragile sites, where they are thought to reflect an increased local rate of DNA breakage. However, most homozygous deletions in cancer genomes are unexplained. Here we identified 2,428 somatic homozygous deletions in 746 cancer cell lines. These overlie 11{\%} of protein-coding genes that, therefore, are not mandatory for survival of human cells. We derived structural signatures that distinguish between homozygous deletions over recessive cancer genes and fragile sites. Application to clusters of unexplained homozygous deletions suggests that many are in regions of inherent fragility, whereas a small subset overlies recessive cancer genes. The results illustrate how structural signatures can be used to distinguish between the influences of mutation and selection in cancer genomes. The extensive copy number, genotyping, sequence and expression data available for this large series of publicly available cancer cell lines renders them informative reagents for future studies of cancer biology and drug discovery.},

abstract = {Large-scale tumor sequencing projects enabled the identification of many new cancer gene candidates through computational approaches. Here, we describe a general method to detect cancer genes based on significant 3D clustering of mutations relative to the structure of the encoded protein products. The approach can also be used to search for proteins with an enrichment of mutations at binding interfaces with a protein, nucleic acid, or small molecule partner. We applied this approach to systematically analyze the PanCancer compendium of somatic mutations from 4,742 tumors relative to all known 3D structures of human proteins in the Protein Data Bank. We detected significant 3D clustering of missense mutations in several previously known oncoproteins including HRAS, EGFR, and PIK3CA. Although clustering of missense mutations is often regarded as a hallmark of oncoproteins, we observed that a number of tumor suppressors, including FBXW7, VHL, and STK11, also showed such clustering. Beside these known cases, we also identified significant 3D clustering of missense mutations in NUF2, which encodes a component of the kinetochore, that could affect chromosome segregation and lead to aneuploidy. Analysis of interaction interfaces revealed enrichment of mutations in the interfaces between FBXW7-CCNE1, HRAS-RASA1, CUL4B-CAND1, OGT-HCFC1, PPP2R1A-PPP2R5C/PPP2R2A, DICER1-Mg(2+), MAX-DNA, SRSF2-RNA, and others. Together, our results indicate that systematic consideration of 3D structure can assist in the identification of cancer genes and in the understanding of the functional role of their mutations. },

At least 1 GA was found in 192 (96{\%}) of CUP specimens, with a mean (SD) of 4.2 (2.8) GAs per tumor. The most frequent GAs were in TP53 (110 [55{\%}]), KRAS (40 [20{\%}]), CDKN2A (37 [19{\%}]), MYC (23 [12{\%}]), ARID1A (21 [11{\%}]), MCL1 (19 [10{\%}]), PIK3CA (17 [9{\%}]), ERBB2 (16 [8{\%}]), PTEN (14 [7{\%}]), EGFR (12 [6{\%}]), SMAD4 (13 [7{\%}]), STK11 (13 [7{\%}]), SMARCA4 (12 [6{\%}]), RB1 (12 [6{\%}]), RICTOR (12 [6{\%}]), MLL2 (12 [6{\%}]), BRAF (11 [6{\%}]), and BRCA2 (11 [6{\%}]). One or more potentially targetable GAs were identified in 169 of 200 (85{\%}) CUP specimens. Mutations or amplifications of ERBB2 were more frequent in ACUPs (13 [10{\%}]) than in non-ACUPs (3 [4{\%}]). Alterations of EGFR (10 [8{\%}] vs 2 [3{\%}]) and BRAF (8 [6{\%}] vs 3 [4{\%}]) were more common in ACUPs than in non-ACUPs. Strikingly, clinically relevant alterations in the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)/Ras signaling pathway including alterations in ALK, ARAF, BRAF, EGFR, FGFR1, FGFR2, KIT, KRAS, MAP2K1, MET, NF1, NF2, NRAS, RAF1, RET, and ROS1 were found in 90 (72{\%}) ACUPs but in only 29 (39{\%}) non-ACUPs (P {\textless} .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Almost all CUP samples harbored at least 1 clinically relevant GA with potential to influence and personalize therapy. The ACUP tumors were more frequently driven by GAs in the highly druggable RTK/Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway than the non-ACUP tumors. Comprehensive genomic profiling can identify novel treatment paradigms to address the limited options and poor prognoses of patients with CUP.},

abstract = {Purpose: To compare the clinical features, natural history, and outcomes for women with “triple-negative” breast cancer with women with other types of breast cancer.Experimental Design: We studied a cohort of 1,601 patients with breast cancer, diagnosed between January 1987 and December 1997 at Women's College Hospital in Toronto. Triple-negative breast cancers were defined as those that were estrogen receptor negative, progesterone receptor negative, and HER2neu negative. The prognostic significance of triple-negative breast cancer was explored.Results: The median follow-up time of the 1,601 women was 8.1 years. One hundred and eighty of 1,601 patients (11.2{\%}) had triple-negative breast cancer. Compared with other women with breast cancer, those with triple-negative breast cancer had an increased likelihood of distant recurrence (hazard ratio, 2.6; 95{\%} confidence interval, 2.0-3.5; P {\textless} 0.0001) and death (hazard ratio, 3.2; 95{\%} confidence interval, 2.3-4.5; P {\textless} 0.001) within 5 years of diagnosis but not thereafter. The pattern of recurrence was also qualitatively different; among the triple-negative group, the risk of distant recurrence peaked at ∼3 years and declined rapidly thereafter. Among the “other” group, the recurrence risk seemed to be constant over the period of follow-up.Conclusions: Triple-negative breast cancers have a more aggressive clinical course than other forms of breast cancer, but the adverse effect is transient. },

abstract = {Screening for germline mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes is indicated for breast cancer patients from high-risk breast cancer families, and influences both treatment options and clinical management. However, only 25{\%} of selected patients test positive for BRCA1/2 mutation, indicating that additional diagnostic biomarkers are necessary. We analyzed 124 FFPE tumor samples from patients with hereditary (104) and sporadic (20) invasive breast cancer, divided into two series (A and B). Microarray expression profiling of 829 human miRNAs was performed on 76 samples (series A), and bioinformatics tool Prophet was used to develop and test a microarray classifier. Samples were stratified into a training set (n=38), for microarray classifier generation and a test set (n=38) for signature validation. A 35-miRNA microarray classifier was generated for the prediction of BRCA1/2 mutation status with a reported 95{\%} (95{\%} CI: 0.88 -1), and 92{\%} (95{\%} CI: 0.84 -1) accuracy in the training and the test set, respectively. Differential expression of 12 miRNAs between BRCA1/2 mutation-carriers versus non-carriers was validated by qPCR in an independent tumor Series B (n=48). Logistic regression model based on the expression of 6 miRNAs (miR-142-3p, miR-505*, miR-1248, miR-181a-2*, miR-25* and miR-340*) discriminated between tumors from BRCA1/2 mutation-carriers and non-carriers with 92{\%} (95{\%} CI: 0.84 -0.99) accuracy. In conclusion, we identified miRNA expression signatures predictive of BRCA1/2 mutation status in routinely available FFPE breast tumor samples, which may be useful to complement current patient selection criteria for gene testing by identifying individuals with high likelihood of being BRCA1/2 mutation carriers. {\textcopyright} 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract = {Cancer genomic instability contributes to the phenomenon of intratumoral genetic heterogeneity, provides the genetic diversity required for natural selection, and enables the exten-sive phenotypic diversity that is frequently observed among patients. Genomic instability has previously been associated with poor prognosis. However, we have evidence that for solid tumors of epithelial origin, extreme levels of genomic instabil-ity, where more than 75{\%} of the genome is subject to somatic copy number alterations, are associated with a potentially better prognosis compared with intermediate levels under this threshold. This has been observed in clonal subpopulations of larger size, especially when genomic instability is shared among a limited number of clones. We hypothesize that cancers with extreme levels of genomic instability may be teetering on the brink of a threshold where so much of their genome is adversely altered that cells rarely replicate successfully. Another possibil-ity is that tumors with high levels of genomic instability are more immunogenic than other cancers with a less extensive burden of genetic aberrations. Regardless of the exact mecha-nism, but hinging on our ability to quantify how a tumor's burden of genetic aberrations is distributed among coexisting clones, genomic instability has important therapeutic implica-tions. Herein, we explore the possibility that a high genomic instability could be the basis for a tumor's sensitivity to DNA-damaging therapies. We primarily focus on studies of epithe-lial-derived solid tumors.},

DNA damage and deficiency of DNA repair systems are two major forces to cause somatic mutations, marking cancer genomes with specific somatic mutation patterns. Recently, several pan-cancer genome studies revealed more than 20 mutation signatures across multiple cancer types. However, detailed cancer-type specific mutation signatures and their different features within (intra-) and between (inter-) cancer types remain largely unexplored.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We employed a matrix decomposition algorithm, namely Non-negative Matrix Factorization, to survey the somatic mutations in nine major human cancers, involving a total of {\~{}}2100 genomes.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Our results revealed 3-5 independent mutational signatures in each cancer, implying that a range of 3-5 predominant mutational processes likely underlie each cancer genome. Both mutagen exposure (tobacco and sun) and changes in DNA repair systems (APOBEC family, POLE, and MLH1) were found as mutagenesis forces, each of which marks the genome with an evident mutational signature. We studied the features of several signatures and their combinatory patterns within and across cancers. On one hand, we found each signature may influence a cancer genome with different influential magnitudes even in the same cancer type and the signature-specific load reflects intra-cancer heterogeneity (e.g., the smoking-related signature in lung cancer smokers and never smokers). On the other hand, inter-cancer heterogeneity is characterized by combinatory patterns of mutational signatures, where no cancers share the same signature profile, even between two lung cancer subtypes (lung adenocarcinoma and squamous cell lung cancer).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Our work provides a detailed overview of the mutational characteristics in each of nine major cancers and highlights that the mutational signature profile is representative of each cancer.},

Methods: We reviewed our experience of Pts treated with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 Abs and correlated their outcomes with PD-L1 and mismatch repair protein (MMR) status by immunohistochemistry (IHC), as well as MSK-IMPACT (≥340-gene) NGS profile. MSIsensor from IMPACT assesses microsatellite instability phenotype, while ≥20 mutations (or 17 mutations/Mb) strongly correlates with MMR-deficiency (dMMR) by IHC (J Clin Oncol 2016;34:2141). Progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were analyzed from the start of IO. Results: 71 Pts were identified, with 3 Pts receiving 2 IO regimens. 66 had adenoCAs and 5 had squamous CAs. Median age 58, 77{\%} male, 96{\%} had received ≥2 prior chemo regimens. 39 (55{\%}), 18 (25{\%}) and 17 Pts (24{\%}) respectively received anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1 and anti-CTLA-4 plus anti-PD-1/PD-L1 Abs. 6 Pts (8{\%}) had objective response (2 complete responses or CRs) and the median PFS and OS are 1.6 and 4.7 mos; 2-yr OS is 17{\%}. PD-L1 IHC was performed in 16 Pts (23{\%}; 7 +ve), MMR was tested in 20 Pts (28{\%}; 4 dMMR) and IMPACT was obtained in 44 Pts (62{\%}). All 4 dMMR tumors were also MSI by MSIsensor and had a median of 46 mutations (range, 29-63) or, equivalently, 33 mutations/Mb (range, 21-46); 2 of 2 dMMR tumors tested PD-L1 +ve. 3 of the 4 Pts with dMMR/MSI tumors had a response (including 1 CR) and the median OS of these 4 Pts is not reached with 23+ months of follow-up. Finally, a patient whose tumor is MMR-proficient, not MSI but has 15 mutations (including in POLD1), achieved an ongoing CR at 37+ mos. For the 44 Pts with IMPACT testing, there appeared to be improved OS for tumors with ≥10 vs. {\textless}10 mutations/Mb (2-yr OS 80{\%} vs. 12{\%}, p=0.03). Conclusions: Pts with tumors that are MSI or have ≥10 mutations/Mb on MSK-IMPACT appear to derive significant benefit from IO. MSK-IMPACT can offer novel information, identify novel mutations (e.g. POLD1) and may be used to help select Pts for IO. We are seeking to define a mutation no. cut-off that can serve as a biomarker and updated data will be presented.},

abstract = {Microsatellite instability (MSI) is a hallmark of hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer, and in these patients, results from inherited defects in DNA mismatch repair genes, mostly MSH2 and MLH1. MSI also occurs in 15{\%} of sporadic colorectal cancers, but in these tumors, its basis is less well characterized. We investigated 46 sporadic MSI+ colorectal cancers for changes in MSH2 and MLH1 protein expression, followed by the analysis of somatic mutation, loss of heterozygosity (LOH), and promoter hypermethylation as possible underlying defects. Most cases (36/46, 78{\%}) showed lost or reduced MLH1 expression. Among these, a majority (83{\%}) was associated with MLH1 promoter hypermethylation, whereas the rates of LOH and somatic mutation of MLH1 were 24{\%} and 13{\%}, respectively. Hypermethylation and LOH were inversely correlated, suggesting that they had alternative functions in the inactivation of MLH1. MSH2 expression was lost in 7/46 (15{\%}), and of these, 2 (29{\%}) showed LOH and/or somatic mutation of MSH2. We conclude that most sporadic MSI+ colorectal cancers have an MLH1-associated etiology and that epigenetic modification is a major mechanism of MLH1 inactivation. Moreover, we found a significantly lower prevalence for MLH1 promoter hypermethylation in hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer tumors with MLH1 germline mutations (12/26, 46{\%}), which might explain some differences that are known to occur in the clinicopathological characteristics and tumorigenic pathways between sporadic and hereditary MSI+ colorectal cancers.},

PREMISE 1: more stem cell divisions in a tissue cause a higher risk of cancer in that tissue.

PREMISE 2: replicative mutation rates per tissue should vary less in a population of same-age individuals than environmental mutation rates

THEREFORE: it is possible to estimate fractions of cancers attributable to H, R, and E. (Mathematical model to do this is in supplementary)

PREMISE 3: Environmental mutations can be prevented, whereas R mutations cannot be.

THEREFORE: Estimates as to the proportion of cancers driven by E should match the fraction of "preventable cancers" per tissue type.

abstract = {Cancer genomic DNA sequences enable identification of all mutations and suggest targets for precision medicine. The identities and patterns of the mutations themselves also provide critical information for deducing the originating DNA damaging agents, causal molecular mechanisms, and thus additional therapeutic targets. A classic example is ultraviolet light, which crosslinks adjacent pyrimidines and leads to C-to-T transitions. A new example is the DNA cytosine deaminase APOBEC3B, which was identified recently as a source of DNA damage and mutagenesis in breast, head/neck, cervix, bladder, lung, ovary, and to lesser extents additional cancer types. This enzyme is normally an effector protein in the innate immune response to virus infection but upregulation in these cancer types causes elevated levels of genomic C-to-U deamination events, which manifest as C-to-T transitions and C-to-G transversions within distinct DNA trinucleotide contexts (preferentially 5'-TCA and 5'-TCG). Genomic C-to-U deamination events within the same trinucleotide contexts also lead to cytosine mutation clusters (kataegis), and may precipitate visible chromosomal aberrations such as translocations. Clinical studies indicate that APOBEC3B upregulation correlates with poorer outcomes for estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer patients, including shorter durations of disease-free survival and overall survival after surgery. APOBEC3B may therefore have both diagnostic and prognostic potential. APOBEC3B may also be a candidate for therapeutic targeting because inhibition of this non-essential enzyme is predicted to decrease tumor mutation rates and diminish the likelihood of undesirable mutation-dependent outcomes such as recurrence, metastasis, and the development of therapy resistant tumors},

abstract = {Specific molecular mechanisms may affect the pattern of mutation in particular regions, and therefore leaving a footprint or signature in the DNA of their activity. The common approach to identify these signatures is studying the frequency of substitutions. However, such an analysis ignores the important spatial information, which is important with regards to the mutation occurrence statistics. In this work, we propose that the study of the distribution of distances between consecutive mutations along the DNA molecule can provide information about the types of somatic mutational processes. In particular, we have found that specific cancer types show a power-law in interoccurrence distances, instead of the expected exponential distribution dictated with the Poisson assumption commonly made in the literature. Cancer genomes exhibiting power-law interoccurrence distances were enriched in cancer types where the main mutational process is described to be the activity of the APOBEC protein family, which produces a particular pattern of mutations called Kataegis. Therefore, the observation of a power-law in interoccurence distances could be used to identify cancer genomes with Kataegis},

abstract = {An abnormal differentiation state is common in BRCA1-deficient mammary epithelial cells, but the underlying mechanism is unclear. Here, we report a convergence between DNA repair and normal, cultured human mammary epithelial (HME) cell differentiation. Surprisingly, depleting BRCA1 or FANCD2 (Fanconi anemia [FA] proteins) or BRG1, a mSWI/SNF subunit, caused HME cells to undergo spontaneous epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and aberrant differentiation. This also occurred when wild-type HMEs were exposed to chemicals that generate DNA interstrand crosslinks (repaired by FA proteins), but not in response to double-strand breaks. Suppressed expression of $\Delta$NP63 also occurred in each of these settings, an effect that links DNA damage to the aberrant differentiation outcome. Taken together with somatic breast cancer genome data, these results point to a breakdown in a BRCA/FA-mSWI/SNF-$\Delta$NP63-mediated DNA repair and differentiation maintenance process in mammary epithelial cells that may contribute to sporadic breast cancer development.

Analysis of three independent urothelial tumor cohorts demonstrates a strong association between somatic ERCC2 mutations and the activity of a mutational signature characterized by a broad spectrum of base changes. In addition, we note an association between the activity of this signature and smoking that is independent of ERCC2 mutation status, providing genomic evidence of tobacco-related mutagenesis in urothelial cancer. Together, these analyses identify an NER-related mutational signature and highlight the related roles of DNA damage and subsequent DNA repair in shaping tumor mutational landscape.},

Here, we report the interim integrative analysis of DNA copy number, gene expression and DNA methylation aberrations in 206 glioblastomas (GBM), the most common type of adult brain cancer, and nucleotide sequence aberrations in 91 of the 206 GBMs. This analysis provides new insights into the roles of ERBB2, NF1 and TP53, uncovers frequent mutations of the PI3 kinase regulatory subunit gene PIK3R1, and provides a network view of the pathways altered in the development of GBM. Furthermore, integration of mutation, DNA methylation and clinical treatment data reveals a link between MGMT promoter methylation and a hypermutator phenotype consequent to mismatch repair deficiency in treated glioblastomas, an observation with potential clinical implications.

abstract = {Motivation: Cancers arise as the result of somatically acquired changes in the DNA of cancer cells. However, in addition to the mutations that confer a growth advantage, cancer genomes accumu-late a large number of somatic mutations resulting from normal DNA damage and repair processes as well as carcinogenic exposures or cancer related aberrations of DNA maintenance machinery. These mutagenic processes often produce characteristic mutational patterns called mutational sig-natures. The decomposition of a cancer genome's mutation catalog into mutations consistent with such signatures can provide valuable information about cancer etiology. However, the results from different decomposition methods are not always consistent. Hence, one needs to be able to not only decompose a patient's mutational profile into signatures but also establish the accuracy of such decomposition. Results: We proposed two complementary ways of measuring confidence and stability of decom-position results and applied them to analyze mutational signatures in breast cancer genomes. We identified both very stable and highly unstable signatures, as well as signatures that previously have not been associated with breast cancer. We also provided additional support for the novel sig-natures. Our results emphasize the importance of assessing the confidence and stability of inferred signature contributions.},
annote = {Huang et al. (2017) implement a simulated annealing (SA) based signature decomposition method.

SA is similar to Metropolis-Hastings. However, rather than generating posterior distributions, SA aims to identify global optima by gradually cooling a "temperature" variable. As T decreases, the search becomes more local rather than global. When T = 1, the sampling resembles MH.

We will need to test this SA-based method objectively. However, there are still some areas where we can provide contributions:

1. Generation of representative posterior distributions
2. Use of density clustering to identify and report alternative solutions
3. Reporting of signature bleed relationships
4. Rich visual plotting for each of the above
5. Potentially integrate the McGranahan method of temporal decomposition},

However, surprisingly few published bioinformatics methods exist for the specific purpose of identifying somatic mutations from NGS data and existing tools are often inaccurate, yielding intolerably high false prediction rates. As such, the computational problem of accurately inferring somatic mutations from paired tumour/normal NGS data remains an unsolved challenge.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We present the comparison of four standard supervised machine learning algorithms for the purpose of somatic SNV prediction in tumour/normal NGS experiments. To evaluate these approaches (random forest, Bayesian additive regression tree, support vector machine and logistic regression), we constructed 106 features representing 3369 candidate somatic SNVs from 48 breast cancer genomes, originally predicted with naive methods and subsequently revalidated to establish ground truth labels. We trained the classifiers on this data (consisting of 1015 true somatic mutations and 2354 non-somatic mutation positions) and conducted a rigorous evaluation of these methods using a cross-validation framework and hold-out test NGS data from both exome capture and whole genome shotgun platforms. All learning algorithms employing predictive discriminative approaches with feature selection improved the predictive accuracy over standard approaches by statistically significant margins. In addition, using unsupervised clustering of the ground truth 'false positive' predictions, we noted several distinct classes and present evidence suggesting non-overlapping sources of technical artefacts illuminating important directions for future study.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nAVAILABILITY: Software called MutationSeq and datasets are available from http://compbio.bccrc.ca.},

Two mutational signatures show clock-like properties. Both exhibit different mutation rates in different tissues.

abstract = {Purpose: Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is an aggressive cancer characterized by extensive brain invasion. Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 plays a major role in this process. GBMs can be divided into two subtypes based on distinct clinical and molecular features. Primary GBMs arise de novo and frequently overexpress the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and its ligand-independent variant, EGFR variant III (EGFRvIII); secondary GBMs progress from a lower grade glioma and commonly harbor p53 mutations. Because EGFR signaling promotes MMP-9 expression and activation in other cancer cell types, we analyzed whether MMP-9 was associated with primary GBM subtype.Experimental Design: Autopsies were performed on 20 GBM patients, and MMP expression was assessed by gelatin zymography in the tumor and the adjacent normal brain. EGFR, EGFRvIII, p53, and activated mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase were assessed by immunohistochemistry, and associations between molecular phenotype and MMP-9 expression were analyzed.Results: Latent MMP-9 was detected in 90{\%} of tumors, and active MMP-9 was found in 50{\%} of tumors. MMP-9 was not detected in any of the normal brain samples (P {\textless} 0.001). More importantly, primary GBMs were significantly more likely than secondary GBMs to contain active MMP-9 (69{\%} of primary and 14{\%} of secondary GBMs contained active MMP-9; P = 0.027). Active MMP-9 was observed in 73{\%} of EGFR-overexpressing/wild-type p53-staining tumors but in only 20{\%} of EGFR-negative/aberrant p53-staining tumors (P = 0.072). Active MMP-9 expression was even more strongly correlated with EGFRvIII expression, occurring in 83{\%} of the EGFRvIII-immunopositive tumors but in none of the EGFRvIII-negative tumors (P = 0.0004). Extracellular signal-regulated kinase activation was also strongly correlated with EGFRvIII expression (P {\textless} 0.0001) and with MMP-9 activation (P = 0.003).Conclusions: These results identify a novel association between MMP-9 activation and primary GBM subtype and suggest that primary GBM patients, especially those whose tumors express EGFRvIII, may benefit from anti-MMP therapy. },

To address this problem we introduce and experimentally validate a new algorithm, virtual inference of protein activity by enriched regulon analysis (VIPER), for accurate assessment of protein activity from gene expression data. We used VIPER to evaluate the functional relevance of genetic alterations in regulatory proteins across all samples in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). In addition to accurately infer aberrant protein activity induced by established mutations, we also identified a fraction of tumors with aberrant activity of druggable oncoproteins despite a lack of mutations, and vice versa. In vitro assays confirmed that VIPER-inferred protein activity outperformed mutational analysis in predicting sensitivity to targeted inhibitors. },

These findings suggest that the chromosomal region 17q12-q23, previously shown to contain a gene for early-onset breast cancer, is also associated with a proportion of hereditary ovarian cancers.},

However, few studies have validated MR derived measurements with histopathology. Here, we determine the correlation of myelin water imaging, an MR measure of myelin content, with quantitative histopathologic measures of myelin density. The multi-component T2 distribution of water was determined from 25 formalin-fixed MS brain samples using a multi-echo T2 relaxation MR experiment. The myelin water fraction (MWF), defined as T2 signal below 30 milliseconds divided by the total signal, was determined for various regions of interest and compared to Luxol fast blue (myelin stain) mean optical density (OD) for each sample. MWF had a strong correlation with myelin stain [mean (range) R2 = 0.67 (0.45-0.92)], validating MWF as a measure of myelin density. This quantitative technique has many practical applications for the in vivo monitoring of demyelination and remyelination in a variety of disorders of myelin.},

abstract = {To identify specific allelic losses that might correlate with postoperative mortality of breast cancer patients treated with high-dose adjuvant chemotherapy consisting of cyclophosphamide, methotrexate and fluorouracil, we examined tumors from a cohort of 150 such patients, who were followed clinically for 5 years postoperatively, for allelic losses (loss of heterozygosity, LOH) among 18 microsatellite markers throughout the genome. Patients whose tumors had lost an allele at 8p22 had significantly higher risks of mortality than those whose tumors retained both alleles at those loci. At 8p22, the 5-year mortality rate was 31{\%} among patients with losses vs. 8{\%} with retention (P=0.0354). No other region showed correlation between LOH and prognosis. The data indicate that LOH at 8p22 is a significant predictor of postoperative mortality for breast cancer patients who received high-dose postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy. Thus, LOH at 8p22 can serve as a negative prognostic indicator to guide postoperative management of patients.},

Such efforts should be greatly aided by robust preclinical model systems that reflect the genomic diversity of human cancers and for which detailed genetic and pharmacological annotation is available. Here we describe the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE): a compilation of gene expression, chromosomal copy number and massively parallel sequencing data from 947 human cancer cell lines. When coupled with pharmacological profiles for 24 anticancer drugs across 479 of the cell lines, this collection allowed identification of genetic, lineage, and gene-expression-based predictors of drug sensitivity. In addition to known predictors, we found that plasma cell lineage correlated with sensitivity to IGF1 receptor inhibitors; AHR expression was associated with MEK inhibitor efficacy in NRAS-mutant lines; and SLFN11 expression predicted sensitivity to topoisomerase inhibitors. Together, our results indicate that large, annotated cell-line collections may help to enable preclinical stratification schemata for anticancer agents. The generation of genetic predictions of drug response in the preclinical setting and their incorporation into cancer clinical trial design could speed the emergence of 'personalized' therapeutic regimens.},

abstract = {Both intrinsic cell state changes and variations in the composition of stem cell populations have been implicated as contributors to aging. We used single-cell RNA-seq to dissect variability in hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) and hematopoietic progenitor cell populations from young and old mice from two strains. We found that cell cycle dominates the variability within each population and that there is a lower frequency of cells in the G1 phase among old compared with young long-term HSCs, suggesting that they traverse through G1 faster. Moreover, transcriptional changes in HSCs during aging are inversely related to those upon HSC differentiation, such that old short-term (ST) HSCs resemble young long-term (LT-HSCs), suggesting that they exist in a less differentiated state. Our results indicate both compositional changes and intrinsic, population-wide changes with age and are consistent with a model where a relationship between cell cycle progression and self-renewal versus differentiation of HSCs is affected by aging and may contribute to the functional decline of old HSCs. {\textcopyright} 2015 Kowalczyk et al.; Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.},

abstract = {Clusters of simultaneous multiple mutations can be a source of rapid change during carcinogenesis and evolution. Such mutation clusters have been recently shown to originate from DNA damage within long single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) formed at resected double-strand breaks and dysfunctional replication forks. Here, we identify double-strand break (DSB)-induced replication (BIR) as another powerful source of mutation clusters that formed in nearly half of wild-type yeast cells undergoing BIR in the presence of alkylating damage. Clustered mutations were primarily formed along the track of DNA synthesis and were frequently associated with additional breakage and rearrangements. Moreover, the base specificity, strand coordination, and strand bias of the mutation spectrum were consistent with mutations arising from damage in persistent ssDNA stretches within unconventional replication intermediates. Altogether, these features closely resemble kataegic events in cancers, suggesting that replication intermediates during BIR may be the most prominent source of mutation clusters across species. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors.},

abstract = {Metastasis involves the spread of cancer cells from the primary tumor to surrounding tissues and to distant organs and is the primary cause of cancer morbidity and mortality. In order to complete the metastatic cascade, cancer cells must detach from the primary tumor, intravasate into the circulatory and lymphatic systems, evade immune attack, extravasate at distant capillary beds, and invade and proliferate in distant organs. Currently, several hypotheses have been advanced to explain the origin of cancer metastasis. These involve an epithelial mesenchymal transition, an accumulation of mutations in stem cells, a macrophage facilitation process, and a macrophage origin involving either transformation or fusion hybridization with neoplastic cells. Many of the properties of metastatic cancer cells are also seen in normal macrophages. A macrophage origin of metastasis can also explain the long-standing "seed and soil" hypothesis and the absence of metastasis in plant cancers. The view of metastasis as a macrophage metabolic disease can provide novel insight for therapeutic management.},

abstract = {Exposure to environmental mutagens is an important cause of human cancer, and measures to reduce mutagenic and carcinogenic exposures have been highly successful at controlling cancer. Until recently, it has been possible to connect the chemical characteristics of mutagens to actual mutations observed in human tumors only indirectly. Now, next-generation sequencing technology enables us to observe in detail the DNA-sequence-level effects of well-known mutagens, such as ultraviolet radiation and tobacco smoke, as well as endogenous mutagenic processes, such as those involving activated DNA cytidine deaminases (APOBECs). We can also observe the effects of less well-known but potent mutagens, including those recently found to be present in some herbal remedies. Crucially, we can now tease apart the superimposed effects of several mutational exposures and processes and determine which ones occurred during the development of individual tumors. Here, we review advances in detecting these mutation signatures and discuss the implications for surveillance and prevention of cancer. The number of sequenced tumors from diverse cancer types and multiple geographic regions is growing explosively, and the genomes of these tumors will bear the signatures of even more diverse mutagenic exposures. Thus, we envision development of wide-ranging compendia of mutation signatures from tumors and a concerted effort to experimentally elucidate the signatures of a large number of mutagens. This information will be used to link signatures observed in tumors to the exposures responsible for them, which will offer unprecedented opportunities for prevention.},

We extend the number of CLL driver alterations, including changes in ZNF292, ZMYM3, ARID1A and PTPN11. We also identify novel recurrent mutations in non-coding regions, including the 3' region of NOTCH1, which cause aberrant splicing events, increase NOTCH1 activity and result in a more aggressive disease. In addition, mutations in an enhancer located on chromosome 9p13 result in reduced expression of the B-cell-specific transcription factor PAX5. The accumulative number of driver alterations (0 to ≥4) discriminated between patients with differences in clinical behaviour. This study provides an integrated portrait of the CLL genomic landscape, identifies new recurrent driver mutations of the disease, and suggests clinical interventions that may improve the management of this neoplasia. },

Eighteen significantly mutated genes were identified, including five genes (RUNX1, CBFB, MYH9, MLL3 and SF3B1) previously linked to haematopoietic disorders. Mutant MAP3K1 was associated with luminal A status, low-grade histology and low proliferation rates, whereas mutant TP53 was associated with the opposite pattern. Moreover, mutant GATA3 correlated with suppression of proliferation upon aromatase inhibitor treatment. Pathway analysis demonstrated that mutations in MAP2K4, a MAP3K1 substrate, produced similar perturbations as MAP3K1 loss. Distinct phenotypes in oestrogen-receptor-positive breast cancer are associated with specific patterns of somatic mutations that map into cellular pathways linked to tumour biology, but most recurrent mutations are relatively infrequent. Prospective clinical trials based on these findings will require comprehensive genome sequencing.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:: BRCAness is defined as shared tumour characteristics between sporadic and BRCA-mutated cancers. However, how to exactly measure BRCAness and its frequency in breast cancer is not known. Assays to establish BRCAness would be extremely valuable for the clinical management of these tumours. We assessed BRCAness characteristics frequencies in a large cohort of triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs). METHODS:: As a measure of BRCAness, we determined a specific BRCA1-like pattern by array Comparative Genomic Hybridisation (aCGH), and BRCA1 promoter methylation in 377 TNBCs, obtained from 3 different patient cohorts. Clinicopathological data were available for all tumours, BRCA1-germline mutation status and chemotherapy response data were available for a subset. RESULTS:: Of the tumours, 66–69{\%} had a BRCA1-like aCGH profile and 27–37{\%} showed BRCA1 promoter methylation. BRCA1-germline mutations and BRCA1 promoter methylation were mutually exclusive events (P=1 × 10(−5)). BRCAness was associated with younger age and grade 3 tumours. Chemotherapy response was significantly higher in BRCA1-mutated tumours, but not in tumours with BRCAness (63{\%} (12 out of 19) vs 35{\%} (18 out of 52) pathological complete remission rate, respectively). CONCLUSION:: The majority of the TNBCs show BRCAness, and those tumours share clinicopathological characteristics with BRCA1-mutated tumours. A better characterisation of TNBC and the presence of BRCAness could have consequences for both hereditary breast cancer screening and the treatment of these tumours. },

abstract = {Mutational hotspots indicate selective pressure across a population of tumor samples, but their prevalence within and across cancer types is incompletely characterized. An approach to detect significantly mutated residues, rather than methods that identify recurrently mutated genes, may uncover new biologically and therapeutically relevant driver mutations. Here, we developed a statistical algorithm to identify recurrently mutated residues in tumor samples. We applied the algorithm to 11,119 human tumors, spanning 41 cancer types, and identified 470 somatic substitution hotspots in 275 genes. We find that half of all human tumors possess one or more mutational hotspots with widespread lineage-, position- and mutant allele-specific differences, many of which are likely functional. In total, 243 hotspots were novel and appeared to affect a broad spectrum of molecular function, including hotspots at paralogous residues of Ras-related small GTPases RAC1 and RRAS2. Redefining hotspots at mutant amino acid resolution will help elucidate the allele-specific differences in their function and could have important therapeutic implications. },

Ongoing intense research efforts continue to alter our understanding of the role of the IDH1 mutation in tumor formation. Currently, evidence suggests the IDH1 mutation to be an early event in tumorigenesis with multiple downstream oncogenic consequences including maintenance of a hypermethylator phenotype, alterations in HIF signalling, and disruption of collagen maturation contributing to a cancer-promoting extracellular matrix. The most recent reports elucidating these mechanisms is described in this review with an emphasis on the pathogenesis of the IDH1 mutation in glioma. Conflicting findings from various studies are discussed, in order to highlight areas warranting further research. Finally, the latest progress in developing novel therapies against the IDH1 mutation is presented, including recent findings from ongoing phase 1 clinical trials and the exciting prospect of vaccine immunotherapy targeting the IDH1 mutant protein. },

We report that APOBEC3B (A3B) is required for regulation of gene expression by ER and acts by causing C-to-U deamination at ER binding regions. We show that these C-to-U changes lead to the generation of DNA strand breaks through activation of base excision repair (BER) and to repair by non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathways. We provide evidence that transient cytidine deamination by A3B aids chromatin modification and remodelling at the regulatory regions of ER target genes that promotes their expression. A3B expression is associated with poor patient survival in ER+ breast cancer, reinforcing the physiological significance of A3B for ER action. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2015 The Authors.

abstract = {BRCA1 (BReast-CAncer susceptibility gene 1) and BRCA2 are tumor suppressor genes, the mutant phenotypes of which predispose to breast and ovarian cancers. Intensive research has shown that BRCA proteins are involved in a multitude of pivotal cellular processes. In particular, both genes contribute to DNA repair and transcriptional regulation in response to DNA damage. Recent studies suggest that BRCA proteins are required for maintenance of chromosomal stability, thereby protecting the genome from damage. New data also show that BRCAs transcriptionally regulate some genes involved in DNA repair, the cell cycle, and apoptosis. Many of these functions are mediated by a large number of cellular proteins that interact with BRCAs. The functions of BRCA proteins are also linked to distinct and specific phosphorylation events; however, the extent to which phosphorylation-activated molecular pathways contribute to tumor suppressor activity remains unclear. Finally, the reasons why mutations in BRCA genes lead to the development of breast and ovarian cancers are not clearly understood. Elucidation of the precise molecular functions of BRCAs is expected to improve our understanding of hereditary as well as sporadic mammary carcinogenesis.},

Reliable interpretation of CNV data, however, is often difficult and requires expertise. With our knowledge of the human genome growing rapidly, applications for array testing continuously broadening, and the resolution of CNV detection increasing, this leads to great complexity in interpreting what can be daunting data. Correct CNV interpretation and optimal use of the genotype information provided by SNP probes on an array depends largely on knowledge present in various resources. In addition to the availability of host laboratories' own datasets and national registries, there are several public databases and Internet resources with genotype and phenotype information that can be used for array data interpretation. With so many resources now available, it is important to know which are fit-for-purpose in a diagnostic setting. We summarise the characteristics of the most commonly used Internet databases and resources, and propose a general data interpretation strategy that can be used for comparative hybridisation, comparative intensity and genotype-based array data. {\textcopyright} 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Oncologists interested in applying NLP for clinical research can play pivotal roles in building NLP systems and, in doing so, contribute to both oncological and clinical NLP research. Herein, we provide an introduction to NLP and its potential applications in oncology, a description of specific tools available, and a review on the state of the current technology with respect to cancer case identification, staging, and outcomes quantification. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE More automated means of leveraging unstructured data from daily clinical practice is crucial as therapeutic options and access to individual-level health information increase. Research-minded oncologists may push the avenues of evidence-based research by taking advantage of the new technologies available with clinical NLP. As continued progress is made with applying NLP toward oncological research, incremental gains will lead to large impacts, building a cost-effective infrastructure for advancing cancer care.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Somatic mutations have the potential to encode "non-self" immunogenic antigens. We hypothesized that tumors with a large number of somatic mutations due to mismatch-repair defects may be susceptible to immune checkpoint blockade.
METHODS: We conducted a phase 2 study to evaluate the clinical activity of pembrolizumab, an anti-programmed death 1 immune checkpoint inhibitor, in 41 patients with progressive metastatic carcinoma with or without mismatch-repair deficiency. Pembrolizumab was administered intravenously at a dose of 10 mg per kilogram of body weight every 14 days in patients with mismatch repair-deficient colorectal cancers, patients with mismatch repair-proficient colorectal cancers, and patients with mismatch repair-deficient cancers that were not colorectal. The coprimary end points were the immune-related objective response rate and the 20-week immune-related progression-free survival rate.
RESULTS: The immune-related objective response rate and immune-related progression-free survival rate were 40{\%} (4 of 10 patients) and 78{\%} (7 of 9 patients), respectively, for mismatch repair-deficient colorectal cancers and 0{\%} (0 of 18 patients) and 11{\%} (2 of 18 patients) for mismatch repair-proficient colorectal cancers. The median progression-free survival and overall survival were not reached in the cohort with mismatch repair-deficient colorectal cancer but were 2.2 and 5.0 months, respectively, in the cohort with mismatch repair-proficient colorectal cancer (hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.10 [P{\textless}0.001], and hazard ratio for death, 0.22 [P=0.05]). Patients with mismatch repair-deficient noncolorectal cancer had responses similar to those of patients with mismatch repair-deficient colorectal cancer (immune-related objective response rate, 71{\%} [5 of 7 patients]; immune-related progression-free survival rate, 67{\%} [4 of 6 patients]). Whole-exome sequencing revealed a mean of 1782 somatic mutations per tumor in mismatch repair-deficient tumors, as compared with 73 in mismatch repair-proficient tumors (P=0.007), and high somatic mutation loads were associated with prolonged progression-free survival (P=0.02).
CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that mismatch-repair status predicted clinical benefit of immune checkpoint blockade with pembrolizumab. (Funded by Johns Hopkins University and others; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01876511.).

abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, noncoding RNAs that play a critical role in developmental and physiological processes and are implicated in the pathogenesis of several human diseases, including cancer. They function by regulating target gene expression post-transcriptionally. In this study, we examined the role of oncogenic mir-21 in the pathogenesis of glioblastoma, the most aggressive form of primary brain tumor. We have previously reported that mir-21 is expressed at higher levels in primary glioblastoma-tissue and glioblastoma-derived cell lines than in normal brain tissue. We demonstrate that downregulation of mir-21 in glioblastoma-derived cell lines results in increased expression of its target, programmed cell death 4 (Pdcd4), a known tumor-suppressor gene. In addition, our data indicate that either downregulation of mir-21 or overexpression of its target, Pdcd4, in glioblastoma-derived cell lines leads to decreased proliferation, increased apoptosis, and decreased colony formation in soft agar. Using a glioblastoma xenograft model in immune-deficient nude mice, we observe that glioblastomaderived cell lines in which mir-21 levels are downregulated or Pdcd4 is over-expressed exhibit decreased tumor formation and growth. Significantly, tumors grow when the glioblastoma-derived cell lines are transfected with anti-mir-21 and siRNA to Pdcd4, confirming that the tumor growth is specifically regulated by Pdcd4. These critical in vivo findings demonstrate an important functional linkage between mir-21 and Pdcd4 and further elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which the known high level of mir-21 expression in glioblastoma can attribute to tumorigenesis—namely, inhibition of Pdcd4 and its tumor-suppressive functions. },

The mutation consequences of disruption to both repair components in humans are not well studied.

High-grade bMMRD brain tumors exhibited massive numbers of substitution mutations ({\textgreater}250/Mb), which was greater than all childhood and most cancers ({\textgreater}7,000 analyzed). All ultra-hypermutated bMMRD cancers acquired early somatic driver mutations in DNA polymerase ɛ or $\delta$. The ensuing mutation signatures and numbers are unique and diagnostic of childhood germ-line bMMRD (P {\textless} 10(-13)). Sequential tumor biopsy analysis revealed that bMMRD/polymerase-mutant cancers rapidly amass an excess of simultaneous mutations (∼600 mutations/cell division), reaching but not exceeding ∼20,000 exonic mutations in {\textless}6 months. This implies a threshold compatible with cancer-cell survival. We suggest a new mechanism of cancer progression in which mutations develop in a rapid burst after ablation of replication repair.},

abstract = {BRCA1 localizes to discrete nuclear foci (dots) during S phase. Hydroxyurea-mediated DNA synthesis arrest of S phase MCF7 cells led to a loss of BRCA1 from these structures. Ultraviolet light, mitomycin C, or gamma irradiation produced a similar effect but with no concurrent arrest of DNA synthesis. BARD1 and Rad51, two proteins associated with the BRCA1 dots, behaved similarly. Loss of the BRCA1 foci was accompanied by a specific, dose-dependent change(s) in the state of BRCA1 phosphorylation. Three distinct DNA damaging agents preferentially induced this change in S phase. The S phase BRCA1 phosphorylation response to DNA damage occurred in cells lacking, respectively, two DNA damage-sensing protein kinases, DNA-PK and Atm, implying that neither plays a prime role in this process. Finally, after BRCA1 dot dispersal, BRCA1, BARD1, and Rad51 accumulated, focally, on PCNA+ replication structures, implying an interaction of BRCA1/BARD1/Rad51 containing complexes with damaged, replicating DNA. Taken together, the data imply that the BRCA1 S phase foci are dynamic physiological elements, responsive to DNA damage, and that BRCA1-containing multiprotein complexes participate in a replication checkpoint response.},

abstract = {Homozygosity has long been associated with rare, often devastating, Mendelian disorders, and Darwin was one of the first to recognize that inbreeding reduces evolutionary fitness. However, the effect of the more distant parental relatedness that is common in modern human populations is less well understood. Genomic data now allow us to investigate the effects of homozygosity on traits of public health importance by observing contiguous homozygous segments (runs of homozygosity), which are inferred to be homozygous along their complete length. Given the low levels of genome-wide homozygosity prevalent in most human populations, information is required on very large numbers of people to provide sufficient power. Here we use runs of homozygosity to study 16 health-related quantitative traits in 354,224 individuals from 102 cohorts, and find statistically significant associations between summed runs of homozygosity and four complex traits: height, forced expiratory lung volume in one second, general cognitive ability and educational attainment (P {\textless} 1 × 10(-300), 2.1 × 10(-6), 2.5 × 10(-10) and 1.8 × 10(-10), respectively). In each case, increased homozygosity was associated with decreased trait value, equivalent to the offspring of first cousins being 1.2 cm shorter and having 10 months' less education. Similar effect sizes were found across four continental groups and populations with different degrees of genome-wide homozygosity, providing evidence that homozygosity, rather than confounding, directly contributes to phenotypic variance. Contrary to earlier reports in substantially smaller samples, no evidence was seen of an influence of genome-wide homozygosity on blood pressure and low density lipoprotein cholesterol, or ten other cardio-metabolic traits. Since directional dominance is predicted for traits under directional evolutionary selection, this study provides evidence that increased stature and cognitive function have been positively selected in human evolution, whereas many important risk factors for late-onset complex diseases may not have been. },

Using next-generation sequencing, we characterize a phenomenon, which we term chromothripsis, whereby tens to hundreds of genomic rearrangements occur in a one-off cellular crisis. Rearrangements involving one or a few chromosomes crisscross back and forth across involved regions, generating frequent oscillations between two copy number states. These genomic hallmarks are highly improbable if rearrangements accumulate over time and instead imply that nearly all occur during a single cellular catastrophe. The stamp of chromothripsis can be seen in at least 2{\%}-3{\%} of all cancers, across many subtypes, and is present in ∼25{\%} of bone cancers. We find that one, or indeed more than one, cancer-causing lesion can emerge out of the genomic crisis. This phenomenon has important implications for the origins of genomic remodeling and temporal emergence of cancer.},

Remarkably, these mutational processes are poorly characterized. Global sequencing initiatives are yielding catalogs of somatic mutations from thousands of cancers, thus providing the unique opportunity to decipher the signatures of mutational processes operative in human cancer. However, until now there have been no theoretical models describing the signatures of mutational processes operative in cancer genomes and no systematic computational approaches are available to decipher these mutational signatures. Here, by modeling mutational processes as a blind source separation problem, we introduce a computational framework that effectively addresses these questions. Our approach provides a basis for characterizing mutational signatures from cancer-derived somatic mutational catalogs, paving the way to insights into the pathogenetic mechanism underlying all cancers. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors.},

Here we distilled thousands of genetic and epigenetic features altered in cancers to {\~{}}500 selected functional events (SFEs). Using this simplified description, we derived a hierarchical classification of 3,299 TCGA tumors from 12 cancer types. The top classes are dominated by either mutations (M class) or copy number changes (C class). This distinction is clearest at the extremes of genomic instability, indicating the presence of different oncogenic processes. The full hierarchy shows functional event patterns characteristic of multiple cross-tissue groups of tumors, termed oncogenic signature classes. Targetable functional events in a tumor class are suggestive of class-specific combination therapy. These results may assist in the definition of clinical trials to match actionable oncogenic signatures with personalized therapies.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Treatment with epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs), such as gefitinib and erlotinib, has achieved high clinical response rates in patients with non–small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs). However, over time, most tumors develop acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs, which is associated with the secondary EGFR T790M resistance mutation in about half the cases. Currently there are no effective treatment options for patients with this resistance mutation. Here we identified two novel HLA-A*0201 (A2)-restricted T cell epitopes containing the mutated methionine residue of the EGFR T790M mutation, T790M-5 (MQLMPFGCLL) and T790M-7 (LIMQLMPFGCL), as potential targets for EGFR-TKI-resistant patients. When peripheral blood cells were repeatedly stimulated {\textless}italic{\textgreater}in vitro{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} with these two peptides and assessed by antigen-specific IFN-$\gamma$ secretion, T cell lines responsive to T790M-5 and T790M-7 were established in 5 of 6 (83{\%}) and 3 of 6 (50{\%}) healthy donors, respectively. Additionally, the T790M-5- and T790M-7-specific T cell lines displayed an MHC class I-restricted reactivity against NSCLC cell lines expressing both HLA-A2 and the T790M mutation. Interestingly, the NSCLC patients with antigen-specific T cell responses to these epitopes showed a significantly less frequency of EGFR-T790M mutation than those without them [1 of 7 (14{\%}) vs 9 of 15 (60{\%}); chi-squared test, p  =  0.0449], indicating the negative correlation between the immune responses to the EGFR-T790M-derived epitopes and the presence of EGFR-T790M mutation in NSCLC patients. This finding could possibly be explained by the hypothesis that immune responses to the mutated neo-antigens derived from T790M might prevent the emergence of tumor cell variants with the T790M resistance mutation in NSCLC patients during EGFR-TKI treatment. Together, our results suggest that the identified T cell epitopes might provide a novel immunotherapeutic approach for prevention and/or treatment of EGFR-TKI resistance with the secondary EGFR T790M resistance mutation in NSCLC patients.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {A key mutational process in cancer is structural variation, in which rearrangements delete, amplify or reorder genomic segments ranging in size from kilobases to whole chromosomes. We developed methods to group, classify and describe structural variants, applied to {\textgreater}2,500 cancer genomes. Nine signatures of structural variation emerged. Deletions have trimodal size distribution; assort unevenly across tumour types and patients; enrich in late-replicating regions; and correlate with inversions. Tandem duplications also have trimodal size distribution, but enrich in early-replicating regions, as do unbalanced translocations. Replication-based mechanisms of rearrangement generate varied chromosomal structures with low-level copy number gains and frequent inverted rearrangements. One prominent structure consists of 1-7 templates copied from distinct regions of the genome strung together within one locus. Such cycles of templated insertions correlate with tandem duplications, frequently activating the telomerase gene, TERT, in liver cancer. Cancers access many rearrangement processes, flexibly sculpting the genome to maximise oncogenic potential.},

abstract = {Much of cancer genetics research has focused on the identification of the most-important somatic mutations ('major drivers') that cause tumour growth. However, many mutations found in cancer might not be major drivers or 'passenger' mutations, but instead might have relatively weak tumour-promoting effects. Our aim is to highlight the existence of these mutations (termed 'mini drivers' herein), as multiple mini-driver mutations might substitute for a major-driver change, especially in the presence of genomic instability or high mutagen exposure. The mini-driver model has clinical implications: for example, the effects of therapeutically targeting such genes may be limited. However, the main importance of the model lies in helping to provide a complete understanding of tumorigenesis, especially as we anticipate that an increasing number of mini-driver mutations will be found by cancer genome sequencing. },

Building on new mechanistic insights emerging from recent research, we offer our perspective on the metastatic process and reflect on possible paths of future exploration. We suggest that metastasis can be portrayed as a two-phase process: The first phase involves the physical translocation of a cancer cell to a distant organ, whereas the second encompasses the ability of the cancer cell to develop into a metastatic lesion at that distant site. Although much remains to be learned about the second phase, we feel that an understanding of the first phase is now within sight, due in part to a better understanding of how cancer cell behavior can be modified by a cell-biological program called the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition.},

Worldwide, tobacco smoking is the principal lifestyle exposure that causes cancer, exerting carcinogenicity through {\textgreater}60 chemicals that bind and mutate DNA. Using massively parallel sequencing technology, we sequenced a small-cell lung cancer cell line, NCI-H209, to explore the mutational burden associated with tobacco smoking. A total of 22,910 somatic substitutions were identified, including 134 in coding exons. Multiple mutation signatures testify to the cocktail of carcinogens in tobacco smoke and their proclivities for particular bases and surrounding sequence context. Effects of transcription-coupled repair and a second, more general, expression-linked repair pathway were evident. We identified a tandem duplication that duplicates exons 3-8 of CHD7 in frame, and another two lines carrying PVT1-CHD7 fusion genes, indicating that CHD7 may be recurrently rearranged in this disease. These findings illustrate the potential for next-generation sequencing to provide unprecedented insights into mutational processes, cellular repair pathways and gene networks associated with cancer.},

abstract = {Purpose: Gene expression profiling classifies breast cancer into intrinsic subtypes based on the biology of the underlying disease pathways. We have used material from a prospective randomized trial of tamoxifen versus placebo in premenopausal women with primary breast cancer (NCIC CTG MA.12) to evaluate the prognostic and predictive significance of intrinsic subtypes identified by both the PAM50 gene set and by immunohistochemistry. Experimental Design: Total RNA from 398 of 672 (59{\%}) patients was available for intrinsic subtyping with a quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) 50-gene predictor (PAM50) for luminal A, luminal B, HER-2–enriched, and basal-like subtypes. A tissue microarray was also constructed from 492 of 672 (73{\%}) of the study population to assess a panel of six immunohistochemical IHC antibodies to define the same intrinsic subtypes. Results: Classification into intrinsic subtypes by the PAM50 assay was prognostic for both disease-free survival (DFS; P ¼ 0.0003) and overall survival (OS; P ¼ 0.0002), whereas classification by the IHC panel was not. Luminal subtype by PAM50 was predictive of tamoxifen benefit [DFS: HR, 0.52; 95{\%} confidence interval (CI), 0.32–0.86 vs. HR, 0.80; 95{\%} CI, 0.50–1.29 for nonluminal subtypes], although the interaction test was not significant (P ¼ 0.24), whereas neither subtyping by central immunohistochemistry nor by local estrogen receptor (ER) or progesterone receptor (PR) status were predictive. Risk of relapse (ROR) modeling with the PAM50 assay produced a continuous risk score in both node-negative and node-positive disease. Conclusions: In the MA.12 study, intrinsic subtype classification by qRT-PCR with the PAM50 assay was superior to IHC profiling for both prognosis and prediction of benefit from adjuvant tamoxifen.},

To investigate the roles of tumor-specific neoantigens and alterations in the tumor microenvironment in the response to ipilimumab, we analyzed whole exomes from pretreatment melanoma tumor biopsies and matching germline tissue samples from 110 patients. For 40 of these patients, we also obtained and analyzed transcriptome data from the pretreatment tumor samples. Overall mutational load, neoantigen load, and expression of cytolytic markers in the immune microenvironment were significantly associated with clinical benefit. However, no recurrent neoantigen peptide sequences predicted responder patient populations. Thus, detailed integrated molecular characterization of large patient cohorts may be needed to identify robust determinants of response and resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitors.

abstract = {From a practical point of view, one of the most difficult issues in the standardization of IHC for FFPE tissue is the adverse influence of formalin upon antigenicity, as well as the great variation in fixation/processing procedures. Based on previous study, an additional study using four markers demonstrated the potential for obtaining equivalent IHC staining among FFPE tissue sections with periods of formalin fixation ranging from 6 hr to 30 days. On this basis, the following hypothesis is proposed. "The use of optimized AR protocols permits retrieval of specific proteins (antigens) from FFPE tissues to a defined and reproducible degree (expressed as R{\%}), with reference to the amount of protein present in the original fresh/unfixed tissue". This hypothesis may also be presented mathematically: the protein amount in a fresh cell/tissue, expressed as Pf, produces an IHC signal in fresh tissue of integral(Pf). When the identical IHC staining plus AR treatment is applied to a FFPE tissue section, the IHC signal may be represented as integral (Pffpe). The degree of retrieval after AR (R{\%}) is calculated as follows: R{\%} = integral (Pffpe)/ integral (Pf) x 100{\%}. The amount of protein in the FFPE tissue may then be derived as follows: Pffpe = Pf x R{\%}. In a situation where optimized AR is 100{\%} effective, the IHC signal would then be of equal strength in fresh tissue and FFPE tissue, and Pffpe= Pf. Further studies are designed to test the limitations of the proposed hypothesis.},

The algorithm can exploit the added information present in correlated longitudinal or multiregion samples and takes into account correlations along genomes caused by events such as copy-number changes. We apply cloneHD to two case studies: a breast cancer sample and time-resolved samples of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, where we demonstrate that monitoring the response of a patient to therapy regimens is feasible.

abstract = {The most common mutations in cancer are C to T transitions, but their origin has remained elusive. Recently, mutational signatures of APOBEC-family cytosine deaminases were identified in many common cancers, suggesting off-target deamination of cytosine to uracil as a common mutagenic mechanism. Here we present evidence from mass spectrometric quantitation of deoxyuridine in DNA that shows significantly higher genomic uracil content in B-cell lymphoma cell lines compared to non-lymphoma cancer cell lines and normal circulating lymphocytes. The genomic uracil levels were highly correlated with AID mRNA and protein expression, but not with expression of other APOBECs. Accordingly, AID knockdown significantly reduced genomic uracil content. B-cells stimulated to express endogenous AID and undergo class switch recombination displayed a several-fold increase in total genomic uracil, indicating that B cells may undergo widespread cytosine deamination after stimulation. In line with this, we found that clustered mutations (kataegis) in lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia predominantly carry AID-hotspot mutational signatures. Moreover, we observed an inverse correlation of genomic uracil with uracil excision activity and expression of the uracil-DNA glycosylases UNG and SMUG1. In conclusion, AID-induced mutagenic U:G mismatches in DNA may be a fundamental and common cause of mutations in B-cell malignancies. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors.

Using whole-genome sequencing on 23 paired Barrett's esophagus and EAC samples, together with one in-depth Barrett's esophagus case study sampled over time and space, we have provided the following new insights: (i) Barrett's esophagus is polyclonal and highly mutated even in the absence of dysplasia; (ii) when cancer develops, copy number increases and heterogeneity persists such that the spectrum of mutations often shows surprisingly little overlap between EAC and adjacent Barrett's esophagus; and (iii) despite differences in specific coding mutations, the mutational context suggests a common causative insult underlying these two conditions. From a clinical perspective, the histopathological assessment of dysplasia appears to be a poor reflection of the molecular disarray within the Barrett's epithelium, and a molecular Cytosponge technique overcomes sampling bias and has the capacity to reflect the entire clonal architecture. },

The 5-year overall survival (OS) for TN tumours following adjuvant/neo-adjuvant chemotherapy was 64{\%} [95{\%} confidence interval (CI) 44{\%} to 79{\%}] compared with 85{\%} (95{\%} CI 79{\%} to 90{\%}) for others. Five-year disease-free survival for TN tumours was 57{\%} (95{\%} CI 37{\%} to 73{\%}) compared with 72{\%} (95{\%} CI 64{\%} to 78{\%}) for others. For patients with advanced breast cancer, overall response rates were 41{\%} for TN tumours and 31{\%} for others (P = 0.3). Patients with TN tumours had a significantly prolonged progression-free survival of 6 months compared with 4 months for others (P = 0.05), though the OS was not significantly different between the two groups (11 versus 7 months).Conclusion: Platinum-based chemotherapy achieves increased response rates for TN tumours, with a trend towards worse survival in early breast cancer through an improved survival in advanced disease. Prospective randomised trials are warranted. },

Until recently, the knowledge of the mutational processes that cause these somatic mutations has been very limited. Recent advances in sequencing technologies and the development of novel mathematical approaches have allowed deciphering the patterns of somatic mutations caused by different mutational processes.

annote = {This paper provided a very interesting look at metastatic tumours. The panel is limited to 410 genes, but captures intronic information, allowing for analysis of rearrangements and CNVs with better confidence than whole exomes.

Notably, roughly 40{\%} of sequenced tumours were metastatic. There was an analysis showing that certain drug resistance associated mutations were more frequent in this dataset than in TCGA.

Overall, many novel mutations were detected in these genes, with a majority of mutations not being detected in COSMIC, despite their gene set being cancer hotspot genes. Another interesting finding was that 97{\%} of genes were mutated in at least 5 (non-hypermutated) tumours, suggesting that tumours are extremely diverse molecularly and that broad capture is good.

Mutation signature exposures were deciphered using the 30-signature set as a reference and minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence. The paper focused on MMR defects, and used orthogonal MSIsensor tool to identify a set of 102 consensus MMR tumours. They also identified UV and TMZ signatures. There was NO analysis of BRCA1/2 signature as predictive for treatment response, and NO analysis of signature 18 association with MUTYH defects.

Despite sequencing of matched normal, it did not appear that there was much exploration of germline findings.

There was no discussion of the relative value of WGS, but they did mention the importance of their 700X sequencing depth. Compared to an exome at 150X sequencing depth, they estimate that a WES would miss roughly 9{\%} of the mutations they detected by panel because of this difference in depth.

Overall, this paper provides a peppering of interesting findings. Perhaps most valuable is the availability of their dataset, which can allow us to verify findings from POG and perform signature analyses.},

abstract = {Recent genomic and biological studies of neuroblastoma have shed light on the dramatic heterogeneity in the clinical behaviour of this disease, which spans from spontaneous regression or differentiation in some patients, to relentless disease progression in others, despite intensive multimodality therapy. This evidence also suggests several possible mechanisms to explain the phenomena of spontaneous regression in neuroblastomas, including neurotrophin deprivation, humoral or cellular immunity, loss of telomerase activity and alterations in epigenetic regulation. A better understanding of the mechanisms of spontaneous regression might help to identify optimal therapeutic approaches for patients with these tumours. Currently, the most druggable mechanism is the delayed activation of developmentally programmed cell death regulated by the tropomyosin receptor kinase A pathway. Indeed, targeted therapy aimed at inhibiting neurotrophin receptors might be used in lieu of conventional chemotherapy or radiation in infants with biologically favourable tumours that require treatment. Alternative approaches consist of breaking immune tolerance to tumour antigens or activating neurotrophin receptor pathways to induce neuronal differentiation. These approaches are likely to be most effective against biologically favourable tumours, but they might also provide insights into treatment of biologically unfavourable tumours. We describe the different mechanisms of spontaneous neuroblastoma regression and the consequent therapeutic approaches.},

We identify several novel mutated genes as well as complex rearrangements of signature receptors, including EGFR and PDGFRA. TERT promoter mutations are shown to correlate with elevated mRNA expression, supporting a role in telomerase reactivation. Correlative analyses confirm that the survival advantage of the proneural subtype is conferred by the G-CIMP phenotype, and MGMT DNA methylation may be a predictive biomarker for treatment response only in classical subtype GBM. Integrative analysis of genomic and proteomic profiles challenges the notion of therapeutic inhibition of a pathway as an alternative to inhibition of the target itself.

Inference of tumor subpopulations has been disproportionately focused on the assessment of somatic point mutations, whereas computational methods targeting evolutionary dynamics of copy number alterations (CNA) and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in whole-genome sequencing data remain underdeveloped. We present a novel probabilistic model, TITAN, to infer CNA and LOH events while accounting for mixtures of cell populations, thereby estimating the proportion of cells harboring each event. We evaluate TITAN on idealized mixtures, simulating clonal populations from whole-genome sequences taken from genomically heterogeneous ovarian tumor sites collected from the same patient. In addition, we show in 23 whole genomes of breast tumors that the inference of CNA and LOH using TITAN critically informs population structure and the nature of the evolving cancer genome. Finally, we experimentally validated subclonal predictions using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and single-cell sequencing from an ovarian cancer patient sample, thereby recapitulating the key modeling assumptions of TITAN.},

This global resurgence is likely linked to increased international travel and commerce in addition to widespread insecticide resistance. Analyses of the C. lectularius sequenced genome (650 Mb) and 14,220 predicted protein-coding genes provide a comprehensive representation of genes that are linked to traumatic insemination, a reduced chemosensory repertoire of genes related to obligate hematophagy, host-symbiont interactions, and several mechanisms of insecticide resistance. In addition, we document the presence of multiple putative lateral gene transfer events. Genome sequencing and annotation establish a solid foundation for future research on mechanisms of insecticide resistance, human-bed bug and symbiont-bed bug associations, and unique features of bed bug biology that contribute to the unprecedented success of C. lectularius as a human ectoparasite. },

abstract = {Primary triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs), a tumour type defined by lack of oestrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and ERBB2 gene amplification, represent approximately 16{\%} of all breast cancers. Here we show in 104 TNBC cases that at the time of diagnosis these cancers exhibit a wide and continuous spectrum of genomic evolution, with some having only a handful of coding somatic aberrations in a few pathways, whereas others contain hundreds of coding somatic mutations. High-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) revealed that only approximately 36{\%} of mutations are expressed. Using deep re-sequencing measurements of allelic abundance for 2,414 somatic mutations, we determine for the first time-to our knowledge-in an epithelial tumour subtype, the relative abundance of clonal frequencies among cases representative of the population. We show that TNBCs vary widely in their clonal frequencies at the time of diagnosis, with the basal subtype of TNBC showing more variation than non-basal TNBC. Although p53 (also known as TP53), PIK3CA and PTEN somatic mutations seem to be clonally dominant compared to other genes, in some tumours their clonal frequencies are incompatible with founder status. Mutations in cytoskeletal, cell shape and motility proteins occurred at lower clonal frequencies, suggesting that they occurred later during tumour progression. Taken together, our results show that understanding the biology and therapeutic responses of patients with TNBC will require the determination of individual tumour clonal genotypes.},

Modules are designed with an emphasis on ease of use, query flexibility, and interactive visualization of results. Phase 3 haplotype data from the 1000 Genomes Project are referenced for calculating pairwise metrics of LD, searching for proxies in high LD, and enumerating all observed haplotypes. LDlink is tailored for investigators interested in mapping common and uncommon disease susceptibility loci by focusing on output linking correlated alleles and highlighting putative functional variants.

abstract = {One important purpose of T cell engineering is to generate tumor-targeted T cells through the genetic transfer of antigen-specific receptors, which consist of either physiological, MHC-restricted T cell receptors (TCRs) or non MHC-restricted chimeric antigen receptors (CARs). CARs combine antigen-specificity and T cell activating properties in a single fusion molecule. First generation CARs, which included as their signaling domain the cytoplasmic region of the CD3zeta or Fc receptor gamma chain, effectively redirected T cell cytotoxicity but failed to enable T cell proliferation and survival upon repeated antigen exposure. Receptors encompassing both CD28 and CD3zeta are the prototypes for second generation CARs, which are now rapidly expanding to a diverse array of receptors with different functional properties. First generation CARs have been tested in phase I clinical studies in patients with ovarian cancer, renal cancer, lymphoma, and neuroblastoma, where they have induced modest responses. Second generation CARs, which are just now entering the clinical arena in the B cell malignancies and other cancers, will provide a more significant test for this approach. If the immunogenicity of CARs can be averted, the versatility of their design and HLA-independent antigen recognition will make CARs tools of choice for T cell engineering for the development of targeted cancer immunotherapies.},

abstract = {Mutation is associated with developmental and hereditary disorders, aging, and cancer. While we understand some mutational processes operative in human disease, most remain mysterious. We used Caenorhabditis elegans whole-genome sequencing to model mutational signatures, analyzing 183 worm populations across 17 DNA repair-deficient backgrounds propagated for 20 generations or exposed to carcinogens. The baseline mutation rate in C. elegans was approximately one per genome per generation, not overtly altered across several DNA repair deficiencies over 20 generations. Telomere erosion led to complex chromosomal rearrangements initiated by breakage-fusion-bridge cycles and completed by simultaneously acquired, localized clusters of breakpoints. Aflatoxin B1 induced substitutions of guanines in a GpC context, as observed in aflatoxin-induced liver cancers. Mutational burden increased with impaired nucleotide excision repair. Cisplatin and mechlorethamine, DNA crosslinking agents, caused dose- and genotype-dependent signatures among indels, substitutions, and rearrangements. Strikingly, both agents induced clustered rearrangements resembling "chromoanasynthesis," a replication-based mutational signature seen in constitutional genomic disorders, suggesting that interstrand crosslinks may play a pathogenic role in such events. Cisplatin mutagenicity was most pronounced in xpf-1 mutants, suggesting that this gene critically protects cells against platinum chemotherapy. Thus, experimental model systems combined with genome sequencing can recapture and mechanistically explain mutational signatures associated with human disease.},

abstract = {All cancers are caused by somatic mutations; however, understanding of the biological processes generating these mutations is limited. The catalogue of somatic mutations from a cancer genome bears the signatures of the mutational processes that have been operative. Here we analysed 4,938,362 mutations from 7,042 cancers and extracted more than 20 distinct mutational signatures. Some are present in many cancer types, notably a signature attributed to the APOBEC family of cytidine deaminases, whereas others are confined to a single cancer class. Certain signatures are associated with age of the patient at cancer diagnosis, known mutagenic exposures or defects in DNA maintenance, but many are of cryptic origin. In addition to these genome-wide mutational signatures, hypermutation localized to small genomic regions, 'kataegis', is found in many cancer types. The results reveal the diversity of mutational processes underlying the development of cancer, with potential implications for understanding of cancer aetiology, prevention and therapy.},

abstract = {The survival of breast cancer patients is largely influenced by tumor characteristics, such as TNM stage, tumor grade and hormone receptor status. However, there is growing evidence that inherited genetic variation might affect the disease prognosis and response to treatment. Several lines of evidence suggest that alleles influencing breast cancer risk might also be associated with breast cancer survival. We examined the associations between 35 breast cancer susceptibility loci and the disease over-all survival (OS) in 10,255 breast cancer patients from the National Cancer Institute Breast and Prostate Cancer Cohort Consortium (BPC3) of which 1,379 died, including 754 of breast cancer. We also conducted a meta-analysis of almost 35,000 patients and 5,000 deaths, combining results from BPC3 and the Breast Cancer Association Consortium (BCAC) and performed in silico analyses of SNPs with significant associations. In BPC3, the C allele of LSP1-rs3817198 was significantly associated with improved OS (HRper-allele =0.70; 95{\%} CI: 0.58-0.85; ptrend  = 2.84 × 10(-4) ; HRheterozygotes  = 0.71; 95{\%} CI: 0.55-0.92; HRhomozygotes  = 0.48; 95{\%} CI: 0.31-0.76; p2DF  = 1.45 × 10(-3) ). In silico, the C allele of LSP1-rs3817198 was predicted to increase expression of the tumor suppressor cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1C (CDKN1C). In the meta-analysis, TNRC9-rs3803662 was significantly associated with increased death hazard (HRMETA =1.09; 95{\%} CI: 1.04-1.15; ptrend  = 6.6 × 10(-4) ; HRheterozygotes  = 0.96 95{\%} CI: 0.90-1.03; HRhomozygotes  = 1.21; 95{\%} CI: 1.09-1.35; p2DF =1.25 × 10(-4) ). In conclusion, we show that there is little overlap between the breast cancer risk single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) identified so far and the SNPs associated with breast cancer prognosis, with the possible exceptions of LSP1-rs3817198 and TNRC9-rs3803662. {\textcopyright} 2015 UICC.},

abstract = {Stan is a probabilistic programming language for specifying statistical models. A Stan program imperatively defines a log probability function over parameters conditioned on specified data and constants. As of version 2.14.0, Stan provides full Bayesian inference for continuous-variable models through Markov chain Monte Carlo methods such as the No-U-Turn sampler, an adaptive form of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling. Penalized maximum likelihood estimates are calculated using optimization methods such as the limited memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno algorithm. Stan is also a platform for computing log densities and their gradients and Hessians, which can be used in alternative algorithms such as variational Bayes, expectation propagation, and marginal inference using approximate integration. To this end, Stan is set up so that the densities, gradients, and Hessians, along with intermediate quantities of the algorithm such as acceptance probabilities, are easily accessible. Stan can be called from the command line using the cmdstan package, through R using the rstan package, and through Python using the pystan package. All three interfaces support sampling and optimization-based inference with diagnostics and posterior analysis. rstan and pystan also provide access to log probabilities, gradients, Hessians, parameter transforms, and specialized plotting.},

abstract = {Tumor recurrence is a leading cause of cancer mortality. Therapies for recurrent disease may fail, at least in part, because the genomic alterations driving the growth of recurrences are distinct from those in the initial tumor. To explore this hypothesis, we sequenced the exomes of 23 initial low-grade gliomas and recurrent tumors resected from the same patients. In 43{\%} of cases, at least half of the mutations in the initial tumor were undetected at recurrence, including driver mutations in TP53, ATRX, SMARCA4, and BRAF, suggesting recurrent tumors are often seeded by cells derived from the initial tumor at a very early stage of their evolution. Notably, tumors from 6 of 10 patients treated with the chemotherapeutic drug temozolomide (TMZ) followed an alternative evolutionary path to high-grade glioma. At recurrence, these tumors were hypermutated and harbored driver mutations in the RB and AKT-mTOR pathways that bore the signature of TMZ-induced mutagenesis. },

But as the sample sizes increase, the list of putatively significant genes identified by current analytical methods continues to grow and is likely to include many false positives. This study shows that this situation stems largely from mutational heterogeneity and presents a novel methodology, MutSigCV, that overcomes the problem by incorporating mutational heterogeneity into the analysis. Application of MutSigCV to more than 3,000 tumour samples from 27 different tumour types shows that mutation frequencies vary more than 1,000-fold between extreme samples both between and within tumour types. And when applied to a data set on lung cancer, MutSigCV reduced the list of significantly mutated genes from 450 to a more manageable 11, most of them previously reported to be mutated in squamous cell lung cancer.},

We develop Genome-wide Reconstruction of Complex Structural Variants (GROC-SVs) for SV detection and assembly from read cloud data and apply this method to Illumina-sequenced 10x Genomics sarcoma and breast cancer data sets. Compared with short-fragment sequencing, GROC-SVs substantially improves the specificity of breakpoint detection at comparable sensitivity. This approach also performs sequence assembly across multiple breakpoints simultaneously, enabling the reconstruction of events exhibiting remarkable complexity. We show that chromothriptic rearrangements occurred before copy number amplifications, and that rates of single-nucleotide variants and SVs are not correlated. Our results support the use of read cloud approaches to advance the characterization of large and complex structural variation.},

Recent studies have led to a better understanding of the molecular biology of peritoneal mesothelioma. Translation of the emerging data into better treatments and outcome is needed. From two patients with peritoneal mesothelioma, we derived whole genome sequences, RNA expression profiles, and targeted deep sequencing data. Molecular data were made available for translation into a clinical treatment plan. Treatment responses and outcomes were later examined in the context of molecular findings. Molecular studies presented here provide the first reported whole genome sequences of peritoneal mesothelioma. Mutations in known mesothelioma-related genes NF2, CDKN2A, LATS2, amongst others, were identified. Activation of MET-related signaling pathways was demonstrated in both cases. A hypermutated phenotype was observed in one case (434 vs. 18 single nucleotide variants) and was associated with a favourable outcome despite sarcomatoid histology and multifocal disease. This study represents the first report of whole genome analyses of peritoneal mesothelioma, a key step in the understanding and treatment of this disease.},

abstract = {UNLABELLED: Visualizing read alignments is the most effective way to validate candidate structural variants (SVs) with existing data. We present svviz, a sequencing read visualizer for SVs that sorts and displays only reads relevant to a candidate SV. svviz works by searching input bam(s) for potentially relevant reads, realigning them against the inferred sequence of the putative variant allele as well as the reference allele and identifying reads that match one allele better than the other. Separate views of the two alleles are then displayed in a scrollable web browser view, enabling a more intuitive visualization of each allele, compared with the single reference genome-based view common to most current read browsers. The browser view facilitates examining the evidence for or against a putative variant, estimating zygosity, visualizing affected genomic annotations and manual refinement of breakpoints. svviz supports data from most modern sequencing platforms.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: A number of large genomic datasets are being generated for studies of human ancestry and diseases. The ADMIXTURE program is commonly used to infer individual ancestry from genomic data.
RESULTS: We describe two improvements to the ADMIXTURE software. The first enables ADMIXTURE to infer ancestry for a new set of individuals using cluster allele frequencies from a reference set of individuals. Using data from the 1000 Genomes Project, we show that this allows ADMIXTURE to infer ancestry for 10,920 individuals in a few hours (a 5 × speedup). This mode also allows ADMIXTURE to correctly estimate individual ancestry and allele frequencies from a set of related individuals. The second modification allows ADMIXTURE to correctly handle X-chromosome (and other haploid) data from both males and females. We demonstrate increased power to detect sex-biased admixture in African-American individuals from the 1000 Genomes project using this extension.
CONCLUSIONS: These modifications make ADMIXTURE more efficient and versatile, allowing users to extract more information from large genomic datasets.

abstract = {Whether and how human tumours are genetically unstable has been debated for decades. There is now evidence that most cancers may indeed be genetically unstable, but that the instability exists at two distinct levels. In a small subset of tumours, the instability is observed at the nucleotide level and results in base substitutions or deletions or insertions of a few nucleotides. In most other cancers, the instability is observed at the chromosome level, resulting in losses and gains of whole chromosomes or large portions thereof. Recognition and comparison of these instabilities are leading to new insights into tumour pathogenesis.},

Here using tumour-normal sample pairs from two different types of cancer, chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and medulloblastoma, we conduct a benchmarking exercise within the context of the International Cancer Genome Consortium. We compare sequencing methods, analysis pipelines and validation methods. We show that using PCR-free methods and increasing sequencing depth to ∼100 × shows benefits, as long as the tumour:control coverage ratio remains balanced. We observe widely varying mutation call rates and low concordance among analysis pipelines, reflecting the artefact-prone nature of the raw data and lack of standards for dealing with the artefacts. However, we show that, using the benchmark mutation set we have created, many issues are in fact easy to remedy and have an immediate positive impact on mutation detection accuracy. },

abstract = {Chromatin factors have emerged as the most frequently dysregulated family of proteins in cancer. We have previously identified the histone deacetylase SIRT6 as a key tumor suppressor, yet whether point mutations are selected for in cancer remains unclear. In this manuscript, we characterized naturally occurring patient-derived SIRT6 mutations. Strikingly, all the mutations significantly affected either stability or catalytic activity of SIRT6, indicating that these mutations were selected for in these tumors. Further, the mutant proteins failed to rescue sirt6 knockout (SIRT6 KO) cells, as measured by the levels of histone acetylation at glycolytic genes and their inability to rescue the tumorigenic potential of these cells. Notably, the main activity affected in the mutants was histone deacetylation rather than demyristoylation, pointing to the former as the main tumor-suppressive function for SIRT6. Our results identified cancer-associated point mutations in SIRT6, cementing its function as a tumor suppressor in human cancer. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2015 The Authors.

CYLDdown-regulation occurred in several malignancies, with tumor-promoting effects. Although we found loss of CYLD expression in hypoxic regions of human glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), the most aggressive brain tumor, biological roles of CYLD in GBM remain unknown. This study aimed to determine the biological significance of CYLD down-regulation to GBM progression and therapy. CYLD mRNA transcription was dramatically down-regulated in hypoxic GBM cells, consistent with our clinical observations of human GBM tissues. Hypoxia enhanced both basal and tumor necrosis factor-{\&}alpha;-induced expression of various proinflammatory cytokines, whereas CYLD overexpression strongly counteracted these responses. In addition, chronic anti-angiogenic therapy with bevacizumab, an anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) antibody, with enhanced hypoxia produced responses similar to these CYLD-regulated proinflammatory responses in a xenograft mouse model. Histologically, CYLD clearly prevented massive immune cell infiltration surrounding necrotic regions, and pseudopalisades appeared in bevacizumab-treated control tumors. Furthermore, CYLD overexpression, which had no impact on survival by itself, significantly improved the prosurvival effect of bevacizumab. These data suggest that CYLD down-regulation is crucial for hypoxia-mediated inflammation in GBM, which may affect the long-term efficacy of anti-VEGF therapy. },

abstract = {Genetically engineered mouse models of lung cancer have demonstrated an important role in understanding the function of novel lung cancer oncogenes and tumor-suppressor genes identified in genomic studies of human lung cancer. Furthermore, these models are important platforms for preclinical therapeutic studies. Here, we generated a mouse model of lung adenocarcinoma driven by mutation of the discoidin domain receptor 2 (DDR2) gene combined with loss of TP53. DDR2(L63V);TP53(L/L) mice developed poorly differentiated lung adenocarcinomas in all transgenic animals analyzed with a latency of 40 to 50 weeks and a median survival of 67.5 weeks. Mice expressing wild-type DDR2 with combined TP53 loss did not form lung cancers. DDR2(L63V);TP53(L/L) tumors displayed robust expression of DDR2 and immunohistochemical markers of lung adenocarcinoma comparable with previously generated models, though also displayed concomitant expression of the squamous cell markers p63 and SOX2. Tumor-derived cell lines were not solely DDR2 dependent and displayed upregulation of and partial dependence on MYCN. Combined treatment with the multitargeted DDR2 inhibitor dasatinib and BET inhibitor JQ1 inhibited tumor growth in vitro and in vivo. Together, these results suggest that DDR2 mutation can drive lung cancer initiation in vivo and provide a novel mouse model for lung cancer therapeutics studies.

abstract = {PURPOSE AND METHODS: Based on preliminary experience, there was a need for modifications and clarifications in the International Neuroblastoma Staging System (INSS) and International Neuroblastoma Response Criteria (INRC). In 1988, a proposal was made to establish an internationally accepted staging system for neuroblastoma, as well as consistent criteria for confirming the diagnosis and determining response to therapy (Brodeur GM, et al: J Clin Oncol 6:1874-1881, 1988). A meeting was held to review experience with the INSS and INRC and to revise or clarify the language and intent of the originally proposed criteria. Substantial changes included a redefinition of the midline, restrictions on age and bone marrow involvement for stage 4S, and the recommendation that meta-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scanning be implemented for evaluating the extent of disease. Other modifications and clarifications of the INSS and INRC are presented. In addition, the criteria for the diagnosis of neuroblastoma were modified. Finally, proposals were made for the development of risk groups that incorporate both clinical and biologic features in the prediction of prognosis. The biologic features that were deemed important to evaluate prospectively included serum ferritin, neuron-specific enolase (NSE), and lactic dehydrogenase (LDH); tumor histology; tumor-cell DNA content; assessment of N-myc copy number; assessment of 1p deletion by cytogenetic or molecular methods; and TRK-A expression. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Modifications of the INSS and INRC made at this conference are presented. In addition, proposals are made for future modifications in these criteria and for the development of International Neuroblastoma Risk Groups. },

These monoclonal antibodies unleash the patient's own immune system to target cancer cells. HNSCC is a good target for these agents as there is ample evidence of active immunosurveillance in the head and neck and a number of immune evasion mechanisms by which HNSCCs form progressive disease including via the PD-1/PD-L1 axis. As HNSCCs typically possess a moderately high mutation burden, they should express numerous mutation-derived antigen targets for immune detection. However, with response rates less than 20{\%} in clinical trials, there is a need for biomarkers to screen patients as well as clinical trials evaluating novel combinations to improve outcomes. The aim of this review is to provide historical and mechanistic context for the use of checkpoint inhibitors in head and neck cancer and provide a perspective on the role of novel checkpoints, biomarkers, and combination therapies that are evolving in the near term for patients with HNSCC.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Invasive lobular breast cancer (ILBC) is the second most common histologic subtype after invasive ductal breast cancer (IDBC). Despite clinical and pathologic differences, ILBC is still treated as IDBC. We aimed to identify genomic alterations in ILBC with potential clinical implications.
METHODS: From an initial 630 ILBC primary tumors, we interrogated oncogenic substitutions and insertions and deletions of 360 cancer genes and genome-wide copy number aberrations in 413 and 170 ILBC samples, respectively, and correlated those findings with clinicopathologic and outcome features.
RESULTS: Besides the high mutation frequency of CDH1 in 65{\%} of tumors, alterations in one of the three key genes of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway, PIK3CA, PTEN, and AKT1, were present in more than one-half of the cases. HER2 and HER3 were mutated in 5.1{\%} and 3.6{\%} of the tumors, with most of these mutations having a proven role in activating the human epidermal growth factor receptor/ERBB pathway. Mutations in FOXA1 and ESR1 copy number gains were detected in 9{\%} and 25{\%} of the samples. All these alterations were more frequent in ILBC than in IDBC. The histologic diversity of ILBC was associated with specific alterations, such as enrichment for HER2 mutations in the mixed, nonclassic, and ESR1 gains in the solid subtype. Survival analyses revealed that chromosome 1q and 11p gains showed independent prognostic value in ILBC and that HER2 and AKT1 mutations were associated with increased risk of early relapse.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that we can now begin to individualize the treatment of ILBC, with HER2, HER3, and AKT1 mutations representing high-prevalence therapeutic targets and FOXA1 mutations and ESR1 gains deserving urgent dedicated clinical investigation, especially in the context of endocrine treatment.

abstract = {Adoptive T-cell therapy (ACT) is a highly intensive immunotherapy regime that has yielded remarkable response rates and many durable responses in clinical trials in melanoma; however, 50–60{\%} of the patients have no clinical benefit. Here, we searched for predictive biomarkers to ACT in melanoma. Whole exome- and transcriptome sequencing and neoantigen prediction were applied to pre-treatment samples from 27 patients recruited to a clinical phase I/II trial of ACT in stage IV melanoma. All patients had previously progressed on other immunotherapies. We report that clinical benefit is associated with significantly higher predicted neoantigen load. High mutation and predicted neoantigen load are significantly associated with improved progression-free and overall survival. Further, clinical benefit is associated with the expression of immune activation signatures including a high MHC-I antigen processing and presentation score. These results improve our understanding of mechanisms behind clinical benefit of ACT in melanoma.},

abstract = {BRCA1 inactivation is a frequent event in basal-like breast carcinomas (BLC). However, BRCA1 can be inactivated by multiple mechanisms and determining its status is not a trivial issue. As an alternate approach, we profiled 65 BLC cases using single-nucleotide polymorphism arrays to define a signature of BRCA1-associated genomic instability. Large-scale state transitions (LST), defined as chromosomal break between adjacent regions of at least 10 Mb, were found to be a robust indicator of BRCA1 status in this setting. Two major ploidy-specific cutoffs in LST distributions were sufficient to distinguish highly rearranged BLCs with 85{\%} of proven BRCA1-inactivated cases from less rearranged BLCs devoid of proven BRCA1-inactivated cases. The genomic signature we defined was validated in a second independent series of 55 primary BLC cases and 17 BLC-derived tumor cell lines. High numbers of LSTs resembling BRCA1-inactivated BLC were observed in 4 primary BLC cases and 2 BLC cell lines that harbored BRCA2 mutations. Overall, the genomic signature we defined predicted BRCA1/2 inactivation in BLCs with 100{\%} sensitivity and 90{\%} specificity (97{\%} accuracy). This assay may ease the challenge of selecting patients for genetic testing or recruitment to clinical trials of novel emerging therapies that target DNA repair deficiencies in cancer.},

abstract = {Invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) is the second most prevalent histologic subtype of invasive breast cancer. Here, we comprehensively profiled 817 breast tumors, including 127 ILC, 490 ductal (IDC), and 88 mixed IDC/ILC. Besides E-cadherin loss, the best known ILC genetic hallmark, we identified mutations targeting PTEN, TBX3, and FOXA1 as ILC enriched features. PTEN loss associated with increased AKT phosphorylation, which was highest in ILC among all breast cancer subtypes. Spatially clustered FOXA1 mutations correlated with increased FOXA1 expression and activity. Conversely, GATA3 mutations and high expression characterized luminal A IDC, suggesting differential modulation of ER activity in ILC and IDC. Proliferation and immune-related signatures determined three ILC transcriptional subtypes associated with survival differences. Mixed IDC/ILC cases were molecularly classified as ILC-like and IDC-like revealing no true hybrid features. This multidimensional molecular atlas sheds new light on the genetic bases of ILC and provides potential clinical options. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

@article{Burns2013,
abstract = {Thousands of somatic mutations accrue in most human cancers, and their causes are largely unknown. We recently showed that the DNA cytidine deaminase APOBEC3B accounts for up to half of the mutational load in breast carcinomas expressing this enzyme. Here we address whether APOBEC3B is broadly responsible for mutagenesis in multiple tumor types. We analyzed gene expression data and mutation patterns, distributions and loads for 19 different cancer types, with over 4,800 exomes and 1,000,000 somatic mutations. Notably, APOBEC3B is upregulated, and its preferred target sequence is frequently mutated and clustered in at least six distinct cancers: bladder, cervix, lung (adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma), head and neck, and breast. Interpreting these findings in the light of previous genetic, cellular and biochemical studies, the most parsimonious conclusion from these global analyses is that APOBEC3B-catalyzed genomic uracil lesions are responsible for a large proportion of both dispersed and clustered mutations in multiple distinct cancers. Somatic mutations are essential for normal cells to develop into cancers. Partial and full tumor genome sequences have shown the existence of hundreds to thousands of mutations in most cancers 1–10 . The observed mutation spectrum is the result of DNA lesions that either escaped repair or were misrepaired. This spectrum can be used to help determine the cause or source of the initial damage. For instance, the cytosine-to-thymine transition bias in skin cancers can be explained by a mechanism in which ultraviolet (UV)-induced lesions—cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (C*C, C*T, T*C or T*T, where asterisks denote UV-induced lesions between adjacent pyrimidines)—are bypassed by DNA polymerase–catalyzed insertion of two adenine bases opposite each unrepaired lesion 11 . A second round of DNA replication or excision and repair of the pyrimidine dimer results in cytosine-to-thymine transitions. Notably, the nature of this type of DNA damage dictates that each resulting cytosine-to-thymine transition occurs in a dipyrimidine context, with each mutated cytosine invariably flanked on the 5′ or the 3′ side by a cytosine or thymine. A similar rationale combining observed mutation spectra and knowledge of biochemical mechanisms may be used to delineate other sources of DNA damage and mutation in human cancers. Nonrandom mutation patterns, such as CG base pairs being more frequently mutated than AT base pairs 1–10 and the occurrence of strand-coordinated clusters of cytosine mutations 9,12,13 (strand-coordinated mutations are those that occur together on a single strand of the DNA double helix), are also observed in other types of cancer. Spontaneous hydrolytic deamination of cytosine to uracil may explain a subset of these events but not the majority, as most occur outside of CpG dinucleotide motifs that can be methylated (the sites most prone to spontaneous deamination), and the occurrence of these mutations in clusters is highly nonrandom. Another possible source of these mutations is enzyme-catalyzed cytosine-to-uracil deamina-tion by one or more of the nine active DNA cytidine deaminases encoded by the human genome. Such a mechanism was originally hypothesized when the DNA deaminase activity of these enzymes was discovered 14 and was recently highlighted with demonstrations of clustered mutations in breast, head and neck, and other cancers 9,12,13 . These mutational clusters have been named kataegis, as their sporadic but concentrated nature bears a likeness to rain showers 9 . Although enzymatic deamination has been implicated in this phenomenon, the actual enzyme responsible has not been determined. Enzyme-catalyzed DNA cytosine-to-uracil deamination is central to both adaptive and innate immune responses. B lymphocytes use activation-induced deaminase (AID) to create antibody diversity by inflicting uracil lesions in the variable regions of expressed immuno-globulin genes, which are ultimately processed into all six types of base-substitution mutations 15,16 (somatic hypermutation). AID also creates uracil lesions in antibody gene switch regions that lead to DNA breaks and the juxtaposition of the expressed and often mutated variable region next to a new constant region (isotype switch recom-bination) 15,16 . In humans, seven related enzymes—APOBEC3A, APOBEC3B, APOBEC3C, APOBEC3D, APOBEC3F, APOBEC3G and APOBEC3H—combine to provide innate immunity to a variety of DNA-based parasitic elements 17,18 . A well-studied example is the cDNA replication intermediate of HIV-1, which during reverse tran-scription is vulnerable to enzymatic deamination by at least three dif-ferent APOBEC3 proteins 19,20 . APOBEC1 also has a similar capacity for viral cDNA deamination, and it is the only family member known to have a biological role in cellular mRNA editing 21–24 . The more distantly related proteins APOBEC2 and APOBEC4 have yet to elicit enzymatic activity. In total, 9 of the 11 APOBEC family members have demonstrated DNA deaminase activity in a variety of biochemical and biological assay systems 14,25–29 .},

abstract = {PURPOSE To describe the frequency of MLH1 promoter methylation in colorectal cancer (CRC); to explore the associations between MLH1 promoter methylation and clinicopathological and molecular factors using a systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS A literature search of the PubMed and Embase databases was conducted to identify relevant articles published up to September 7, 2012 that described the frequency of MLH1 promoter methylation or its associations with clinicopathological and molecular factors in CRC. The pooled frequency, odds ratio (OR) and 95{\%} confidence intervals (95{\%} CI) were calculated. RESULTS The pooled frequency of MLH1 promoter methylation in unselected CRC was 20.3{\%} (95{\%} CI: 16.8-24.1{\%}). They were 18.7{\%} (95{\%} CI: 14.7-23.6{\%}) and 16.4{\%} (95{\%} CI: 11.9-22.0{\%}) in sporadic and Lynch syndrome (LS) CRC, respectively. Significant associations were observed between MLH1 promoter methylation and gender (pooled OR = 1.641, 95{\%} CI: 1.215-2.215; P = 0.001), tumor location (pooled OR = 3.804, 95{\%} CI: 2.715-5.329; P{\textless}0.001), tumor differentiation (pooled OR = 2.131, 95{\%} CI: 1.464-3.102; P{\textless}0.001), MSI (OR: 27.096, 95{\%} CI: 13.717-53.526; P{\textless}0.001). Significant associations were also observed between MLH1 promoter methylation and MLH1 protein expression, BRAF mutation (OR = 14.919 (95{\%} CI: 6.427-34.631; P{\textless}0.001) and 9.419 (95{\%} CI: 2.613-33.953; P = 0.001), respectively). CONCLUSION The frequency of MLH1 promoter methylation in unselected CRC was 20.3{\%}. They were 18.7{\%} in sporadic CRC and 16.4{\%} in LS CRC, respectively. MLH1 promoter methylation may be significantly associated with gender, tumor location, tumor differentiation, MSI, MLH1 protein expression, and BRAF mutation.},

abstract = {Mutations in sunlight-induced melanoma arise from cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs), DNA photoproducts that are typically created picoseconds after an ultraviolet (UV) photon is absorbed at thymine or cytosine. We found that in melanocytes, CPDs are generated for {\textgreater}3 hours after exposure to UVA, a major component of the radiation in sunlight and in tanning beds. These "dark CPDs" constitute the majority of CPDs and include the cytosine-containing CPDs that initiate UV-signature C→T mutations. Dark CPDs arise when UV-induced reactive oxygen and nitrogen species combine to excite an electron in fragments of the pigment melanin. This creates a quantum triplet state that has the energy of a UV photon but induces CPDs by energy transfer to DNA in a radiation-independent manner. Melanin may thus be carcinogenic as well as protective against cancer. These findings also validate the long-standing suggestion that chemically generated excited electronic states are relevant to mammalian biology.},

Two objective responses were observed among the four patients accrued after relapse that followed high-dose/stem-cell therapies. The median time to progression was 14 weeks. The median time to progression for objective responders was 23.5 weeks, with a range of 8 to 68 weeks.

abstract = {Genomic mutations caused by cytotoxic agents used in cancer chemotherapy may cause secondary malignancies as well as contribute to the evolution of treatment-resistant tumour cells. The stable diploid genome of the chicken DT40 lymphoblast cell line, an established DNA repair model system, is well suited to accurately assay genomic mutations. We use whole genome sequencing of multiple DT40 clones to determine the mutagenic effect of eight common cytotoxics used for the treatment of millions of patients worldwide. We determine the spontaneous mutagenesis rate at 2.3 × 10–10 per base per cell division and find that cisplatin, cyclophosphamide and etoposide induce extra base substitutions with distinct spectra. After four cycles of exposure, cisplatin induces 0.8 mutations per Mb, equivalent to the median mutational burden in common leukaemias. Cisplatin-induced mutations, including short insertions and deletions, are mainly located at sites of putative intrastrand crosslinks. We find two of the newly defined cisplatin-specific mutation types as causes of the reversion of BRCA2 mutations in emerging cisplatin-resistant tumours or cell clones. Gemcitabine, 5-fluorouracil, hydroxyurea, doxorubicin and paclitaxel have no measurable mutagenic effect. The cisplatin-induced mutation spectrum shows good correlation with cancer mutation signatures attributed to smoking and other sources of guanine-directed base damage. This study provides support for the use of cell line mutagenesis assays to validate or predict the mutagenic effect of environmental and iatrogenic exposures. Our results suggest genetic reversion due to cisplatin-induced mutations as a distinct mechanism for developing resistance.},

abstract = {The dynamics of adaptation determine which mutations fix in a population, and hence how reproducible evolution will be. This is central to understanding the spectra of mutations recovered in the evolution of antibiotic resistance 1 , the response of pathogens to immune selection 2,3 , and the dynamics of cancer progression 4,5 . In laboratory evolution experiments, demonstrably beneficial muta-tions are found repeatedly 6–8 , but are often accompanied by other mutations with no obvious benefit. Here we use whole-genome whole-population sequencing to examine the dynamics of genome sequence evolution at high temporal resolution in 40 replicate Saccharomyces cerevisiae populations growing in rich medium for 1,000 generations. We find pervasive genetic hitchhiking: mul-tiple mutations arise and move synchronously through the popu-lation as mutational 'cohorts'. Multiple clonal cohorts are often present simultaneously, competing with each other in the same population. Our results show that patterns of sequence evolution are driven by a balance between these chance effects of hitchhiking and interference, which increase stochastic variation in evolution-ary outcomes, and the deterministic action of selection on indi-vidual mutations, which favours parallel evolutionary solutions in replicate populations. Evolutionary adaptation is driven by the accumulation of beneficial mutations. The traditional view is that these dynamics are dominated by rare beneficial 'driver' mutations that occasionally survive drift and increase in frequency until they fix (a 'selective sweep') 9,10 . This impli-citly assumes that at most a single beneficial mutation is present in the population at once. However, recent experiments have shown that even for modestly sized populations of microbes and viruses, beneficial mutation rates are large enough 11,12 that multiple driver mutations spread simultaneously, an effect known as 'clonal interference'. This means that the fate of each mutation depends not only on its own effect on fitness but also on the rest of the variation in the population: neutral or deleterious mutations can fix if they occur in very fit genetic back-grounds, and beneficial mutations occurring in unfit lineages cannot succeed 13–17},

abstract = {Mismatch repair (MMR)-deficient cancers have been discovered to be highly responsive to immune therapies such as PD-1 checkpoint blockade, making their definition in patients, where they may be relatively rare, paramount for treatment decisions. In this study, we utilized patterns of mutagenesis known as mutational signatures, which are imprints of the mutagenic processes associated with MMR deficiency, to identify MMR-deficient breast tumors from a whole-genome sequencing dataset comprising a cohort of 640 patients. We identified 11 of 640 tumors as MMR deficient, but only 2 of 11 exhibited germline mutations in MMR genes or Lynch Syndrome. Two additional tumors had a substantially reduced proportion of mutations attributed to MMR deficiency, where the predominant mutational signatures were related to APOBEC enzymatic activity. Overall, 6 of 11 of the MMR-deficient cases in this cohort were confirmed genetically or epigenetically as having abrogation of MMR genes. However, IHC analysis of MMR-related proteins revealed all but one of 10 samples available for testing as MMR deficient. Thus, the mutational signatures more faithfully reported MMR deficiency than sequencing of MMR genes, because they represent a direct pathophysiologic readout of repair pathway abnormalities. As whole-genome sequencing continues to become more affordable, it could be used to expose individually abnormal tumors in tissue types where MMR deficiency has been rarely detected, but also rarely sought.

Here we analyze 11,020 de novo mutations from the whole genomes of 250 families. We show that de novo mutations in the offspring of older fathers are not only more numerous but also occur more frequently in early-replicating, genic regions. Functional regions exhibit higher mutation rates due to CpG dinucleotides and show signatures of transcription-coupled repair, whereas mutation clusters with a unique signature point to a new mutational mechanism. Mutation and recombination rates independently associate with nucleotide diversity, and regional variation in human-chimpanzee divergence is only partly explained by heterogeneity in mutation rate. Finally, we provide a genome-wide mutation rate map for medical and population genetics applications. Our results provide new insights and refine long-standing hypotheses about human mutagenesis. },

abstract = {BACKGROUND Aristolochic acid (AA) is a natural compound found in many plants of the Aristolochia genus, and these plants are widely used in traditional medicines for numerous conditions and for weight loss. Previous work has connected AA-mutagenesis to upper-tract urothelial cell carcinomas and hepatocellular carcinomas. We hypothesize that AA may also contribute to bladder cancer. METHODS Here, we investigated the involvement of AA-mutagenesis in bladder cancer by sequencing bladder tumor genomes from two patients with known exposure to AA. After detecting strong mutational signatures of AA exposure in these tumors, we exome-sequenced and analyzed an additional 11 bladder tumors and analyzed publicly available somatic mutation data from a further 336 bladder tumors. RESULTS The somatic mutations in the bladder tumors from the two patients with known AA exposure showed overwhelming AA signatures. We also detected evidence of AA exposure in 1 out of 11 bladder tumors from Singapore and in 3 out of 99 bladder tumors from China. In addition, 1 out of 194 bladder tumors from North America showed a pattern of mutations that might have resulted from exposure to an unknown mutagen with a heretofore undescribed pattern of A {\textgreater} T mutations. Besides the signature of AA exposure, the bladder tumors also showed the CpG {\textgreater} TpG and activated-APOBEC signatures, which have been previously reported in bladder cancer. CONCLUSIONS This study demonstrates the utility of inferring mutagenic exposures from somatic mutation spectra. Moreover, AA exposure in bladder cancer appears to be more pervasive in the East, where traditional herbal medicine is more widely used. More broadly, our results suggest that AA exposure is more extensive than previously thought both in terms of populations at risk and in terms of types of cancers involved. This appears to be an important public health issue that should be addressed by further investigation and by primary prevention through regulation and education. In addition to opportunities for primary prevention, knowledge of AA exposure would provide opportunities for secondary prevention in the form of intensified screening of patients with known or suspected AA exposure.},

Here, we measure the single-cell expression distributions of approximately 900 Saccharomyces cerevisiae promoters across four environmental conditions using flow cytometry, and find that gene expression noise is tightly coupled to the environment and is generally higher at lower growth rates. Nutrient-poor conditions, which support lower growth rates, display elevated levels of noise for most promoters, regardless of their specific expression values. We present a simple model of noise in expression that results from having an asynchronous population, with cells at different cell-cycle stages, and with different partitioning of the cells between the stages at different growth rates. This model predicts non-monotonic global changes in noise at different growth rates as well as overall higher variability in expression for cell-cycle-regulated genes in all conditions. The consistency between this model and our data, as well as with noise measurements of cells growing in a chemostat at well-defined growth rates, suggests that cell-cycle heterogeneity is a major contributor to gene expression noise. Finally, we identify gene and promoter features that play a role in gene expression noise across conditions. Our results show the existence of growth-related global changes in gene expression noise and suggest their potential phenotypic implications. {\textcopyright} 2015 Keren et al.; Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.},

abstract = {Purpose: Recent studies have identified mutation signatures of homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) in over 20{\%} of breast cancers, as well as pancreatic, ovarian, and gastric cancers. There is an urgent need to understand the clinical implications of HRD signatures. Whereas BRCA1/2 mutations confer sensitivity to platinum-based chemotherapies, it is not yet clear whether mutation signatures can independently predict platinum response.Experimental Design: In this observational study, we sequenced tumor whole genomes (100× depth) and matched normals (60×) of 93 advanced-stage breast cancers (33 platinum-treated). We computed a published metric called HRDetect, independently trained to predict BRCA1/2 status, and assessed its capacity to predict outcomes on platinum-based chemotherapies. Clinical endpoints were overall survival (OS), total duration on platinum-based therapy (TDT), and radiographic evidence of clinical improvement (CI).Results: HRDetect predicted BRCA1/2 status with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.94 and optimal threshold of 0.7. Elevated HRDetect was also significantly associated with CI on platinum-based therapy (AUC = 0.89; P = 0.006) with the same optimal threshold, even after adjusting for BRCA1/2 mutation status and treatment timing. HRDetect scores over 0.7 were associated with a 3-month extended median TDT (P = 0.0003) and 1.3-year extended median OS (P = 0.04).Conclusions: Our findings not only independently validate HRDetect, but also provide the first evidence of its association with platinum response in advanced breast cancer. We demonstrate that HRD mutation signatures may offer clinically relevant information independently of BRCA1/2 mutation status and hope this work will guide the development of clinical trials.

Methods We analyzed the genomes of 200 clinically annotated adult cases of de novo AML, using either whole-genome sequencing (50 cases) or whole-exome sequencing (150 cases), along with RNA and microRNA sequencing and DNA-methylation analysis. Results AML genomes have fewer mutations than most other adult cancers, with an average of only 13 mutations found in genes. Of these, an average of 5 are in genes that are recurrently mutated in AML. A total of 23 genes were significantly mutated, and another 237 were mutated in two or more samples. Nearly all samples had at least 1 nonsynonymous mutation in one of nine categories of genes that are almost certainly relevant for pathogenesis, including transcription-factor fusions (18{\%} of cases), the gene encoding nucleophosmin (NPM1) (27{\%}), tumor-suppressor genes (16...},

abstract = {All cancers carry somatic mutations. The patterns of mutation in cancer genomes reflect the DNA damage and repair processes to which cancer cells and their precursors have been exposed. To explore these mechanisms further, we generated catalogs of somatic mutation from 21 breast cancers and applied mathematical methods to extract mutational signatures of the underlying processes. Multiple distinct single- and double-nucleotide substitution signatures were discernible. Cancers with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations exhibited a characteristic combination of substitution mutation signatures and a distinctive profile of deletions. Complex relationships between somatic mutation prevalence and transcription were detected. A remarkable phenomenon of localized hypermutation, termed "kataegis," was observed. Regions of kataegis differed between cancers but usually colocalized with somatic rearrangements. Base substitutions in these regions were almost exclusively of cytosine at TpC dinucleotides. The mechanisms underlying most of these mutational signatures are unknown. However, a role for the APOBEC family of cytidine deaminases is proposed. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by abnormal accumulation of $\beta$-amyloid and tau and synapse dysfunction in memory-related neural circuits. Pathological and functional changes in the medial temporal lobe, a region essential for explicit memory encoding, contribute to cognitive decline in AD. Surprisingly, functional imaging studies show increased activity of the hippocampus and associated cortical regions during memory tasks in presymptomatic and early AD stages, whereas brain activity declines as the disease progresses. These findings suggest an emerging scenario where early pathogenic events might increase neuronal excitability leading to enhanced brain activity before clinical manifestations of the disease, a stage that is followed by decreased brain activity as neurodegeneration progresses. The mechanisms linking pathology with synaptic excitability and plasticity changes leading to memory loss in AD remain largely unclear. Recent studies suggest that increased brain activity parallels enhanced expression of genes involved in synaptic transmission and plasticity in preclinical stages, whereas expression of synaptic and activity-dependent genes are reduced by the onset of pathological and cognitive symptoms. Here, we review recent evidences indicating a relationship between transcriptional deregulation of synaptic genes and neuronal activity and memory loss in AD and mouse models. These findings provide the basis for potential clinical applications of memory-related transcriptional programs and their regulatory mechanisms as novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets to restore brain function in AD and other cognitive disorders.      },

Here, to uncover new biomarkers of sensitivity and resistance to cancer therapeutics, we screened a panel of several hundred cancer cell lines--which represent much of the tissue-type and genetic diversity of human cancers--with 130 drugs under clinical and preclinical investigation. In aggregate, we found that mutated cancer genes were associated with cellular response to most currently available cancer drugs. Classic oncogene addiction paradigms were modified by additional tissue-specific or expression biomarkers, and some frequently mutated genes were associated with sensitivity to a broad range of therapeutic agents. Unexpected relationships were revealed, including the marked sensitivity of Ewing's sarcoma cells harbouring the EWS (also known as EWSR1)-FLI1 gene translocation to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors. By linking drug activity to the functional complexity of cancer genomes, systematic pharmacogenomic profiling in cancer cell lines provides a powerful biomarker discovery platform to guide rational cancer therapeutic strategies.},

The WGS and RNA-seq data were analyzed by a team of bioinformaticians and cancer oncologists, and separately by IBM Watson Genomic Analytics (WGA), an automated system for prioritizing somatic variants and identifying drugs. Results: More variants were identified by WGS/RNA analysis than by targeted panels. WGA completed a comparable analysis in a fraction of the time required by the human analysts.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Aristolochic acid (AA) is a natural compound found in many plants of the Aristolochia genus, and these plants are widely used in traditional medicines for numerous conditions and for weight loss. Previous work has connected AA-mutagenesis to upper-tract urothelial cell carcinomas and hepatocellular carcinomas. We hypothesize that AA may also contribute to bladder cancer.
METHODS: Here, we investigated the involvement of AA-mutagenesis in bladder cancer by sequencing bladder tumor genomes from two patients with known exposure to AA. After detecting strong mutational signatures of AA exposure in these tumors, we exome-sequenced and analyzed an additional 11 bladder tumors and analyzed publicly available somatic mutation data from a further 336 bladder tumors.
RESULTS: The somatic mutations in the bladder tumors from the two patients with known AA exposure showed overwhelming AA signatures. We also detected evidence of AA exposure in 1 out of 11 bladder tumors from Singapore and in 3 out of 99 bladder tumors from China. In addition, 1 out of 194 bladder tumors from North America showed a pattern of mutations that might have resulted from exposure to an unknown mutagen with a heretofore undescribed pattern of A {\textgreater} T mutations. Besides the signature of AA exposure, the bladder tumors also showed the CpG {\textgreater} TpG and activated-APOBEC signatures, which have been previously reported in bladder cancer.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the utility of inferring mutagenic exposures from somatic mutation spectra. Moreover, AA exposure in bladder cancer appears to be more pervasive in the East, where traditional herbal medicine is more widely used. More broadly, our results suggest that AA exposure is more extensive than previously thought both in terms of populations at risk and in terms of types of cancers involved. This appears to be an important public health issue that should be addressed by further investigation and by primary prevention through regulation and education. In addition to opportunities for primary prevention, knowledge of AA exposure would provide opportunities for secondary prevention in the form of intensified screening of patients with known or suspected AA exposure.

Specifically, we found RHOA mutations in 14.3{\%} of diffuse-type tumors but not in intestinal-type tumors (P {\textless} 0.001). The mutations clustered in recurrent hotspots affecting functional domains and caused defective RHOA signaling, promoting escape from anoikis in organoid cultures.
