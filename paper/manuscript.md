![**Signature M3 occurs as a result of cisplatin exposure.** It was recently demonstrated that signature M3 could be induced in cell lines by treatment with cisplatin. Our findings provide independent discovery of this mutation signature in clinical samples. Signature M3 was deciphered during *de novo* mutation signature analysis in five cancer types. Elevation of signature M3 was observed in association with 16 cancers of various types previously treated with cisplatin.](figures/platinum_m3-1.png){#fig:m3-platinum-association}
